Bail Application No.163/2019 :- \r\n---header-ends---\r\nThis is an application for grant of ad interim anticipatory bail under section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, for the offence punishable under section 376 of the Indian Penal Code in crime No. 848/18 registered with Kondhava police station, Pune. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2] The prosecution case in short is that complainant lodged report that she was married in February 2013, she was married to one Pramod Gaikwad. The applicant was residing near the maternal house of complainant. The applicant used to go to her matrimonial home to meet her. Her husband suspected on her character and divorced her. The accused had forcible sexual intercourse with her during the period from 2013 to 2018 on the false promise of marriage. When she and her mother insisted for marriage, the accused and his family members refused. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3] Heard Advocate Shri. Azheruddin for the applicant. Perused documentary evidence placed on record. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4] The learned counsel of applicant vehemently argued that the present accused has not committed any offence as alleged and they has been falsely implicated on suspicion. There is no iota of evidence against the applicant. The custody of the applicant is not at all required for investigation. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5] It is specifically argued by learned counsel of applicant that applicant is innocent and he has not committed any offence as alleged and therefore he is entitled for the relief of ad interim anticipatory bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6] On perusal of the copy of F.I.R., it appears that the complainant has made specific allegations that the applicant that he has kept forcible physical relations with her on the pretext of marriage and then refused for marriage. Prima facie involvement of the applicant in the offence in question appears. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n7] Considering the allegations made in the F.I.R. and considering the gravity of the offence, it cannot be said that custodial interrogation of the applicant is not necessary. 8] Considering these facts together, considering the allegations made in the F.I.R. and considering the nature and gravity of the offences alleged to have been committed by the applicant, I am of the view that this is not a fit case to grant ad interim anticipatory bail to the applicant. Hence, the following order :- \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER The application is rejected. \r\n---order-ends---\r\n( Mrs. M.M. Deshpande) Date: 9-1-2019. Additional Sessions Judge, Pune.
