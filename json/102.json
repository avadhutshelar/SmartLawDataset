Suddenly all accused came near him carrying wooden sticks and accused Jitendera Jaiswal asked the Complainant that why you stopped after seeing us and you become arrogant and we will show you consequences and abused complainant and thereafter snatched his wallet containing Rs.5,000/­ and then caused damage to the Swift car of the complainant and also break the glass of other two four­wheelers and caused damage to three two­wheelers by wooden stick. Hence, Complainant called people for help, but they were threatened. Hence, complainant lodged complaint. Accordingly this offence came to be registered. Applicant came to be arrested on 27/11/2018. Now he is in MCR. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3] Ld. Advocate for the applicant in his argument stated that applicant is innocent. He has not committed any offence. Offence is not punishable with death or life imprisonment. Seven accused of this crime are already released on bail. This applicant is entitled to be released on bail on the ground of parity. There was delay in lodging complaint. Investigation is almost completed. His further detention in jail is not necessary. Hence, he may be released on bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4] Ld. APP strongly opposed this application. It is her contention that applicant and his co­accused were armed with wooden rods. They created terror in the mind of complainant and robbed his wallet containing Rs.5,000/­. They caused damage to four and two­wheelers of complainant and his tenant and other persons of that vicinity. Investigation is not yet completed. There is possibility of tampering the prosecution witnesses and evidence. Hence, this application may be rejected. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5] On the same day robbed cash amount was recovered from accused Jitendra Jaiswal. Police already recovered wooden stumps from accused Ganesh Gaikwad. Now nothing remained to be recovered or discovered from him. Further detention of applicant is not necessary till filing of charge­sheet. Therefore, I pass the following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER 1. Bail Application No.121/2019 is allowed. 2. Applicant­Aniket @ Anil Sandip Bhosale be released on bail in CR No.51/2018 registered with Chikhali Police Station, Pune, under sections 395, 323, 504, 506 of IPC, under sections 3, 7 of Criminal Law Amendment Act, on furnishing PR bond of Rs. 3 Bail application no. 121/2019 25,000/­ (Rs.
