Bail application No. 58 /2019 1. This is an application U/s.439 of Cr.P.C. filed by the applicants­accused for grant of bail in connection with Crime No.574/2018, registered with Paud Police Station for the offence punishable u/s.7 and 12 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2. Prosecution case is that applicant/accused No.1, who is Tahasildar of Taluka Mulshi, Distrtict­Pune by taking disadvantage of his post, made demand of bribe amount of Rs.1 crore to the original complainant­Suryakant Shitole, for giving order, mutation and 7/12 extract, therefore, original complainant approached to Anti­ Corruption Bureau, Pune. Thereafter, ACB, Pune by following due procedure, carried raid on 30//12/2018, and caught the applicants/accused Nos. 1 and 2 raid handed while accepting bag of bribe amount. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3. Learned counsel for applicants/accused submitted that applicants­accused have not committed an offence and they have falsely implicated in this offence. He further submitted that twin test of demand and acceptance at the instance has not been proved through panchanama. He further submitted practically investigation is completed, therefore, custodial interrogation of the applicants­ accused are not necessary. He further submitted that nothing incriminating has been recovered at the instance of present applicants/accused, therefore, they be released on bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4. On the other hand, learned APP submitted that except denial and allegations, no specific ground has been mentioned in the 2 bail application. He further submitted that there is oral, documentary, electronic, specific evidence are available against both the applicants/ accused. He further submitted that both the applicants speak against each other as per evidence collected. He further submitted that investigation is at crucial stage, therefore, at this stage, if applicants/accused are released on bail, there is possibility of tampering the prosecution evidence. He further submitted that amount of bribe amount is very huge and if the applicants/accused are released on bail, it will send wrong message to the society. He further submitted that the applicants/accused are influenced persons. There is possibility of tampering the evidence. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5. On perusing record, prima facie it reveals that applicant/accused No.1 is Tahasildar of Tal. Mulshi, District Pune, and he along with applicant/accussed No.2 caught while accepting bribe amount, for providing order of mutation and 7/12 extracts. Moreover, it seems that practically investigation is completed. Thus, custodial interrogation of the applicants/accused is now not necessary. Therefore, considering all these aspects, in my view if present applicants­accused are released on bail on certain conditions, no prejudice will be caused to the prosecution. Hence, I pass the following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER i. Application is allowed. ii. The applicants/accused­Sachin Mahadev Dongre and Mr. Kisan Soma Banekar, be released on bail on furnishing P.R. Bond of Rs.25,000/­ (Rupees Twenty five Thousand Only) each with one or two solvent sureties in like amount. iii. The applicants­accused shall not tamper with prosecution evidence. 3 iv.
