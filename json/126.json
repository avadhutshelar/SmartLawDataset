Heard both the learned Counsel. 2. By this application under Section 439 of Cr.P.C., applicant / accused – Tanmay Chaitanya Thakur, in Crime No. 880/2018 registered on 26.12.2018 with Yerwada Police Station, Pune, under Sections 279, 304A, 304(II), 338 of Indian Penal Code and under Section 184, 132 (a)(c) of the Motor Vehicles Act, seeks regular bail. It is objected over nature of offence and on going investigation. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n3. The learned Counsel for the applicant has vehemently submitted that the offence under Section 304 (II) does not attract, however, learned Magistrate while rejecting the bail application erroneously observed that and directed the I.O. to add this Section. Rest Sections are bailable. Since beginning the applicant is cooperating I.O., hence he deserves bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4. On the contrary, learned Counsel for the complainant and AGP have submitted that soon after the accident, the applicant fled away, instead of referring the victims to hospital. Thus, his role is attributed from FIR. ­ \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5. On going through FIR, it is conspicuous that on 26.12.2018 at 12.30 midnight, the informant accompanied with another pillion rider was travelling by two wheeler being driven by Areik. Near Arnold School, Adarshnagar, Vadgaonsheri, one four wheeler came from opposite direction and rammed on to scooter,. In that accident, duo sustained head injuries, a four wheeler did not stop, somebody referred them to Sahyadri Hospital and thereafter to Ruby Hospital, where duo were declared dead. Initially, offence under Section 304 A with allied sections of IPC and Motor Vehicles Act, however, when the accused was produced before Magistrate, on its own the Magistrate has added offence under Section 304(II) of IPC, by observing that accused had knowledge of consequences. There is no material on record that the accused was aware how much injuries were sustained by the victims and in ordinary course, they were sufficient to cause death. It was just an accident. The only inaction on the part of the accused is that he could refer the victims to hospital, but he did not. For, the prosecution has charged by Section 132(a) of MV Act. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6. Secondly, the applicant was apprehended on 04.01.2019 and since then he is behind bar. Between the period, maximum investigation could be completed. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n7. Thirdly, the applicant is professional interior designer, has no criminal antecedents, much less are not placed on record. It is true that in the mishap two innocents have lost their lives. The FIR reveals that to some extent the deceased had invited peril, since there were two pillion riders. The possibility of losing balance soon after seeing another vehicle came from opposite direction at midnight or due to headlight thereof, cannot be ruled out. By detaining the applicant, no fruitful purpose could be served of prosecution, but to levy certain conditions would suffice the purpose. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n8. Considering nature of offence, the applicant has no criminal antecedents, is permanent resident of Pune, having own profession and maximum investigation is over, in my view applicant deserves conditional bail. Hence, the order : \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER 1. Application stands allowed as under:­ Applicant be released on furnishing P.R.Bond of Rs. 15,000/­ together with solvent surety of like amount on following -4­ conditions : a] He shall not tamper prosecution witnesses. b] He shall not leave India sans the permission of this Court.
