  "processedText": "Criminal Bail Application No.148/2019 CNR NO. MHPU01­000617­2019 Haribhau Laxman Bhagat …. Applicant. Vs. State of Maharashtra …. Respondent. \r\n---header-ends---\r\nORDER BELOW EXH.1 This is the first bail application for regular bail under Section 439 of the Criminal Procedure Code, in connection with CR No.3/2019 registered by Uttamnagar police station, for the offence punishable under section 306 r/w 34 of the Indian Penal Code. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n[2] Perused the application and say given by respondent at Exh.3. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[3] Heard learned advocate Mr. Deokar for the applicant and APP Mr. Aurangabadkar for the State. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[4] The learned advocate Mr. Deokar for the applicant argued that the accused is falsely implicated in the present crime just because his brother had filed similar type of complaint against the informant and his family members when applicant\u0027s niece committed suicide. He further argued that from the FIR, prima­ facie it is not made out that accused abetted deceased Ananta to commit suicide. Admittedly, the applicant is Police­Patil and he has no criminal antecedents. There is no likelihood of his getting absconded as he is permanent resident of Pune. He prayed for release of accused on bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[5] Per­contra, learned APP argued that the offence in question is serious in nature. Having regard to the fact that accused / applicant is Police Patil and he is influential person and the possibility cannot be ruled out that he may tamper with the prosecution evidence. He prayed for rejection of the application. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[6] I have carefully gone through the FIR in the present crime and also the copy of the FIR registered by Haveli police station in the year 2013, in which the present informant and his family members are arrayed as accused for the offence under section 306 of the IPC. Admittedly, the present applicant / accused when was produced before JMFC on the first date of his production, was taken in judicial custody and the police machinery has not challenged the said order, it cannot be said that accused / applicant did not co­operate in the investigation. Having regard to the totality of the allegations made in the FIR, the nature of the offence and the above discussed circumstances, I find that no purpose will be served by keeping the accused / applicant behind bar. So far as apprehension expressed by the learned APP regarding tampering with the evidence, the care of the same can be taken by imposing needful conditions and hence the following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER [1] The application is allowed. [2] The applicant Haribhau Laxman Bhagat is released on bail, on his executing PR Bond of Rs.20,000/­ with one or two sureties of like amount, in connection with C.R.No. 03/2019, registered by Uttamnagar police station, on following conditions :­ [A] The applicant / accused shall not tamper with the prosecution evidence in any manner. [B] The applicant / accused shall co­operate the investigating agency during investigation and he shall not repeat any offence. [3] Bail before concerned JMFC. \r\n---order-ends---\r\nPune, Dated/­18­01­2019 ( Aniruddha Y. Thatte ) Additional Sessions Judge, Pune.
