  "processedText": "ORDER BELOW EXH.01 IN CRI. BAIL APPLN. NO. 40/2019 Punya Bhagwan Kale Vs. State of Maharashtra \r\n---header-ends---\r\nThis is an application for regular bail as per section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Heard advocate Mr. F. N. Maner for applicant. He submitted that in Crime No.220/2015 registered with Phaltan City Police Station for the offences punishable under sections 376­D, 366 etc. read with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, applicant is behind the bars since 09/01/2019. He is in Magisterial custody. Part of his custodial interrogation is over. He is falsely implicated at the instance of informant. He is local resident and the sole earning member in the family. He is ready to furnish surety to the satisfaction of this Court and is also ready to obey with all the conditions those may be imposed upon him. His entire family is dependent upon him. Other accused is already released on bail in Criminal M.A. No 478/2016 as per order dated 14/09/2016. Observation is made in that order that the prosecutrix has filed an affidavit stating that she has lodged the FIR out of heat of anger and she wanted to withdraw it. Therefore he prayed that by imposing certain conditions, applicant may be released on bail. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2. APP Mrs. Diwakar by filing her say at Exh.8 strongly resisted the application. She submitted that alleged offences are antisocial and heinous. Applicant along with other accused abducted the informant from Phaltan to Pune and by confining her in a room for three days, repeatedly committed rape upon her. He was absconding for four years. If he is released on bail then again he is likely to abscond. He is criminal on record. Though the charge sheet is filed, prosecution is ready to conduct the trial. If he is released on bail then he is likely to tamper with the evidence of prosecution. Therefore she submitted that application may be rejected. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3. Applicant was arrested on 09/01/2019 and was produced before the JMFC Phaltan on 10/01/2019. Police did not ask for his police custody. It shows that his presence was not required by them for custodial interrogation. Investigation is completed. Police have submitted supplementary charge­sheet against him. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4. Other accused is already released on bail on 14/09/2016 in Criminal M.A. No. 478/2016. My learned Predecessor has observed in that order that the prosecutrix has filed an affidavit stating that she has lodged the FIR out of heat of anger and she wanted to withdraw from it. Considering this aspect and also on the ground of parity, applicant deserves to be released on bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5. Applicant is local resident and happens to be the sole earning member in his family. When he has already undergone custodial interrogation then no purpose of the prosecution would be served by keeping him behind the bars for an inordinate period. Informant and witnesses are residing at Sonawadi Tal. Phaltan while applicant is resident of Wadale Tal. Phaltan. If some conditions are imposed then it would serve the purpose of prosecution. Hence the order follows :­ \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER 1 Application is allowed. 2 In Crime No. 220/2015 registered with Phaltan City Police Station for the offences punishable under sections 376­D, 366 etc. read with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, applicant Punya Bhagwan Kale, be released on bail upon his executing P.R.
