  "processedText": "CNR­MHPU01­017658­2018 CNR­MHPU01­0000377­2019 COMMON ORDER BELOW EXH.1 IN CRIMINAL BAIL APPLN NO. 18/2019 and 98/2019 Perused the second bail application of Ganesh Babu Sakat and bail application of Shubham Rahul Shinde and say thereon. Perused police papers. Heard the learned Advocate Shri. Malwiya for the applicant / accused Ganesh and Shri. S.D.Swami for applicant Shubham Shinde and APP Shri. Salvi for the State. \r\n---header-ends---\r\n2] It is the case of the Prosecution that on 20.11.2018 from 12.30 p.m to 16.30 p.m., the applicant along with other accused persons accosted the complainant, assaulted him with iron rod and belt and took away Rs. 31,000/­ and one mobile phone and also demanded Rs. 2,00,000/­ as extortion money, thereby, committed an offence punishable under Sec/s. 364(A), 394 r.w. 34 of Indian Penal Code, as CR No. 647/2018 with Sinhagad Police Station. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n3] The learned Counsel Shri. Malwiya for the applicant Ganesh submitted that his name does not figure in FIR. He was arrested on 21.11.2018. Nothing is recovered from him. His cash of Rs. 1000/­ is seized from his pocket. He has no role to play. Identification parade is conducted by applicant accused is not identified. There is no material and antecedents against him. For sufficient period he is behind bar. Conducting identification parade is itself is change in circumstances.\r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4] The learned Counsel Shri. Swami for the applicant Shubham submitted that the complainant and his friend had assaulted the accused Shubham. He was admitted in hospital. He was not absconding. He was arrested on 28.12.2018. As per story of prosecution deceased was kidnapped on two wheeler and taken round in the whole village is not probable. Nothing is to be recovered from him. Most of the investigation is completed and only charge sheet is to be submitted. He is young. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5] Learned APP Shri. Salvi for State submitted that name of the accused Ganesh is figured in FIR. Role of applicants have specifically stated by the witnesses. There is no change in circumstances. Charge sheet is yet to be submitted. Offence is serious one. Section 364A of Indian Penal Code prescribed death or life, whereas, Section 394 of Indian Penal Code is prescribed life or 10 years imprisonment.  \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6] Previous bail application No. 4867/2018 of accused Ganesh Babu Sakat came to be rejected on dt. 10.12.2018. In case papers I have not found any documents to show that identification parade is completed and applicant Ganesh is not identified by the victim. Therefore, at this stage it is very difficult to hold that there is change in circumstances to entertain this second bail application. On the contrary, in the say of police they have specifically mentioned that identification parade is yet to be conducted. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n7] From the face of record rather from the statement of victim Dilip Mane it can specifically seen the overt act of the applicant Shubham Shinde. He had caught hold the caller of Dilip Mane and forcibly took him on motorcycle and taken him to the terrace of building of SRA. He has also assaulted him by iron rod and belt. He is prime accused in the present case as per statement of victim. Investigation is not completed. Charge is not filed. Offence is serious one. Captial punishment is provided for the offence punishable under Section 364A of Indian Penal Code. Hence, in my view both applicants are not entitled for bail. Hence, I proceed to pass the following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER 1] Both Criminal Bail Applications are hereby rejected. 2] Copy of this order be attached with Criminal Bail Application No. 98/2019. \r\n---order-ends---\r\nsd/­­­­ Pune.
