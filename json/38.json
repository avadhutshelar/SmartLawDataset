Moreover from FIR, it reveals that on 21/10/2018, Sachin Mali received information about incident, therefore, he rushed to the spot of incident,and shifted injured to the hospital. Moreover, from the statement of witness­Amit Pawar, it reveals that on 21/10/2018 at about 01­30 p.m., when he was proceeding by Tilak road, Pune, he heard shouts from dilapidated building, therefore, he gave call to Police Control Room, and thereafter, he along with his brother entered in the said building, where he found victim in injured condition. He caught other three boys including present applicant/accused. Moreover, Dinesh Kamble­ injured in his statement stated that on instigation of present applicant/accused, Mahesh Tiwari­ juvenile in conflict inflicted blow of knife on his forehead, abdomen etc., and caused injuries. Thus, as per statement of injured­Dinesh Kamble, accused­Mahesh Tiwar­ juvenile in conflict inflicted blow of knife on him and caused grievous injuries. So far as allegations against present applicant/ accused is concerned, at the time of incident, he suggested to Mahesh Tiwari – juvenile in conflict for making assault. Moreover, it appears that present applicant/accused is in custody from 21/10/2018. Investigating officer has already seized knife used for the alleged commission of offence. Thus,custodial interrogation of present applicant/accused is now not necessary. Therefore, considering all these aspects, in my view if present applicant­accused is released 3 on bail on certain conditions, no prejudice will be caused to the prosecution. Hence, I pass the following order.",
