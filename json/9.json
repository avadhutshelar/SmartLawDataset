S. 135 of Bombay Police Act and under section 4 (25) of Arms Act. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2] It is the case of prosecution that, Complainant Farook Ambir Mulla Police Naik of Crime Branch, Unit no.2, Pimpri Chinchwad, filed complaint alleging therein that on 04/12/2018 at 00.40 hours near compound wall of Narmada Garden Lawns, applicant along with other persons found in possession of incriminating articles and they were in preparation of committing dacoity at Shree Jewellers hence applicants were arrested by Sangavi police station on 04/12/2018. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3] Advocate for the applicants in his argument stated that co­accused of these two accused Mr. Ramesh Ahuja was granted bail by this court. These applicants are also similarly placed hence on the ground of parity they be released on bail. Investigation is almost completed and nothing remained to be recovered or discovered from these applicants. Hence, they may be released on bail. 2 \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4] Ld. DGP strongly opposed this application. It is her contention that these applicants are originally belonging to Nepal. If they will be released on bail, they will flee away from justice. Therefore, their bail application was rightly rejected by learned magistrate. If they will be released on bail, there is possibility of repetition of offence. So also there is possibility of tampering prosecution witnesses and evidence. Therefore, this application may be rejected. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5] In this application and in police papers, the address of these applicants is mentioned as Sanghvi, Pune and Kalyan Phata, Panvel Road, Mumbai respectively. They are permanent resident of Tikapur Nepal and District Survet, Nepal but merely for this reason bail cannot be refused to them. Nothing remained to be recovered or discovered from them. Therefore, their further detention in jail is not necessary. By imposing stringent conditions they can be released on bail.
