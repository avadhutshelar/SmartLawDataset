Heard Advocate for applicant and APP for the State. 2] This is second bail application filed under section 438 of Cr.P.C. by applicant in respect of apprehension of his arrest in C.R. no. 470/18 registered at Wanwadi Police Station for the offence punishable under section 376(2) (i), 376(2)(n), 504, 506 of the Indian Penal Code and under section 4,8,12 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. \r\n---background-ends---\r\nIt is alleged that father of victim lodged report stating that his neighborer told him prior to 4 days to check pregnancy of victim. First informant and his wife inquired with victim and victim told that she and applicant were acquainted with each other since 2017 through friend namely Rupali, once applicant called her near Nala where he tried to create intimacy with her, she refused but he committed forcible sexual intercourse with her by giving threats. Act was repeated since August 2017 till April 2018 from time to time and by giving threats. As a result of which victim became pregnant. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3] According to applicant he is falsely implicated in this case. There is delay in lodging report. During period since 01/08/2017 till 11/04/2018, victim never complained to anyone. There is love affair between victim and applicant. Her parents opposed relationship. Victim consented for sexual relationship. Applicant never forced victim. Victim became pregnant and delivered baby boy on 18.12.2018. Subsequently, with the consent of parents of both applicant and victim their marriage was performed on 21.12.2018. First anticipatory bail was rejected as investigation was going on. But now due to subsequent development custodial interrogation with applicant is not required and there is no possibility of giving threat and pressure by applicant to victim. Family members of applicant are depending on him. Applicant is resident of Hadapsar, Pune and has no criminal antecedents. Due to levelling of offences punishable under section 376(2) (i), 376(2)(n) of the Indian Penal Code and under section 4,8 of POCSO Act there is apprehension in his mind about the arrest. So, he prayed to grant protection under section 438 of Code of Criminal Procedure. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4] A.P.P. and I.O. objected application on the ground that investigation is in progress. First Information Report was given against applicant . As victim delivered child DNA examination is to be conducted. Yet statement of victim under section 164 of Cr.P.C. is not recorded. Entire investigation is going on. Medical examination of victim and applicant is to be conducted. Material information is to be gathered from applicant. So, as investigation is going on they prayed to reject the application. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5] Allegations against the applicant are serious. From First Information Report role attributed to applicant can be gathered. It revealed that applicant committed forcible sexual intercourse with victim from time to time and by giving threats. Victim became pregnant and delivered child. Investigation in that regard is going on. Subsequently, applicant come with case of performance of marriage with victim immediately after rejection of first anticipatory bail application. In that regard he filed on record xerox copy of Nikah Register and date of marriage is 21.12.2018. First anticipatory bail application was rejected on 19.12.2018. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6] Advocate of applicant also relied on affidavit of original complainant stating that due to marriage of applicant with victim as 3 Cri.Bail Application no. 13/2019 CNR No. MHPU01-000015-2019 per Muslim Rites and Customs he has no grievance against applicant. Therefore, he also prayed to grant protection . However, one cannot ignore that at the time of incident victim was minor. There is no much dispute about this fact. Moreover, yet statement of victim before Police and before Court under section 164 of Cr.P.C. is yet not recorded. Police have to investigate so far as subsequent development after rejecting first anticipatory bail is concerned. Therefore, definitely material information is to be gathered. Investigation in this matter is going on. Due to delivery of child medical examination taking DNA samples are the procedural investigation part. In such circumstances and considering possibility of tampering prosecution evidence, it is not proper to grant interim protection to the applicant. There is nothing on the record at present to show love affair between victim and applicant. Per contra, she narrated to her father about forcible sexual intercourse by applicant to her. Due to all above reasons, application deserves to be rejected with following order ­ \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER The application is rejected. \r\n---order-ends---\r\nPune.
