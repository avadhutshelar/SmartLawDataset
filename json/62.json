(CNR – MHPU01 – 000269 -2018) \r\n---header-ends---\r\nOrder below Exh.1 (Passed on this 10th day of January, 2019) This is an application under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, for grant of bail to the applicant/accused for the offences punishable under Sections 306, 323 and 504 of the Indian Penal Code in Crime No.693/2018, registered with Bharati Vidyapeeth Police Station, Pune. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2] The prosecution case, in short, is that the complainant Chaurangnath Sukhdeo Dhumal lodged report to the police station Bharati Vidyapeeth inter alia contending that his daughter Sonal got married with Balasaheb, the applicant/accused. He started illtreating her by consuming liquor and by coming late at night and by suspecting on her character by quarreling with her and made her to commit suicide. The accused has illtreated her physically and mentally. Therefore, she committed suicide on 26-12-2018 by hanging. On these allegations, report is lodged and offence punishable under sections 306, 323 and 504 of the Indian Penal Code came to be registered against the accused and others vide crime No. 2 693/18. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3] The contention of the applicant/accused is that he has not committed any offence as alleged. He is not concerned with the allegations made by the complainant in the complaint. There is no previous complaint lodged by the complainant or deceased or any relative regarding alleged harassment. Investigation of the case is completed and nothing remained to be recovered at the hands of applicant/accused. There is no prima facie evidence against the applicant. He is ready to cooperate police in investigation. He will not abscond. He will not tamper with the prosecution evidence. The family of applicant depends upon him for their livelihood. He is ready to abide by the terms and conditions that may be imposed by this Court. Lastly, he prayed to release him on bail.\r\n---argument-ends---\r\n 4] The learned A.P.P. has opposed the application by filing say at Exh.4 on the ground that spot panchnama is already prepared. The saree used in the commission of crime is already seized from the spot. The statements of witnesses have already been recorded. Further investigation is in progress. The accused has abetted commission of suicide by the deceased. If he is released on bail, he will pressurize the prosecution witnesses. Lastly, he prayed to reject the application. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5] Heard learned A.P.P. for the State. Heard learned Advocate for accused. Gone through the record. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6] In view of these facts, following points arise for determination and findings thereon are recorded against each of them, for the reasons stated below : Points Findings 1. Whether the accused is entitled for bail ? No. 2. What order ? As per final order. REASONS Point No.1 :- \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n7] On perusal of contents of F.I.R., it clearly reveals that the marriage of deceased and applicant was solemnized on 12-3-2018. The accused used to illtreat her by consuming liquor and by coming home late. The accused used to quarrel with her. Deceased used to inform this fact to the complainant and other family members on telephone. The complainant had given understanding to the accused time and again, but there was no change in his behaviour. The accused used to suspect on he character and on these counts also, there were disputes between deceased and the accused. On 25-12-2018 at about 9.30 p.m., deceased phoned her mother an had informed that the accused is illtreating her and she has fed up with the life. At that time, her mother gave understanding to her, but on 26-12-2018 in the morning, complainant received information that the deceased has committed suicide by hanging. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n8] The contents of FIR and statements of witnesses clearly reveal that soon before her death, she had intimated to her mother about illtreatment caused to her at the hands of accused. It is also worth mentioning here that the marriage between deceased and accused was solemnized on 12-3-2018 and suicide is committed on 26-12-2018 i.e. within 9 months of the date of marriage. The investigation is in progress. Prima facie Prima facie involvement of the accused appears in the offence in question. The apprehension of the prosecution is well founded from the act of the accused person. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n9] Considering these facts and considering the nature and gravity of offence and the role played by the accused in the offence in question, I am of the view that 5 Cri. B.A. No. 73/19. this is not a fit case to exhaust judicial discretion of bail. Therefore, it is not just and desirable to release the applicant/accused on bail. Hence, following order is passed. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER Application (Exh.1) stands rejected. \r\n---order-ends---\r\n(Mrs. M.M.
