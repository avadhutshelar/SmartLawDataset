No.42/2019 (Passed on 08­01­2019) \r\n---header-ends---\r\n1] This is an application U/sec. 439 of Cr.P.C. for grant of bail to applicant­accused Mrs Priyanka Dilip Shelar in CR No.145/2018 registered with Shivajinagar police station, U/sec. 420, 465, 467, 468, 471 r/w 34 of Indian Penal Code, 1860. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2] Heard Ld. Counsel on behalf of applicant­accused Shri. Shahid Akhtar and Ld. APP Shri. Bombatkar. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3] Prima­facie from record and submissions of Ld. Counsel on behalf of both parties it is found that informant Vinay Vivek Arhana and his father Vivek Arhana are running Rozary Education Society and they are partners of the said education society. They had engaged Adv. Sagar Suryawanshi as their legal advisor for the work of their said education society and even for other legal advise including finance etc. He had compelled informant to make a facility agreement with his wife Sheetal Tejwani, which was later on cancelled. They both have falsely represented to informant that they are owner of land S.No. 394/2 at Talegaon and convinced the informant to purchase the said land. The informant purchased their land and mortgaged the same with Cosmos Bank. But, later on it is found that they are not owners of said land. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4] Adv. Sagar Suryawanshi, his wife Sheetal Tejwani and present applicant Adv. Priyanaka Shelar in collusion with each other have prepared false affidavits and papers of the informant for Rozary Education Society and thereby filed false special civil suit no. 1598/15. In said suit, present applicant has filed her Vakalatnama and affidavit. But on enquiry, it is found that they have forged the affidavit, documents and vakalatnama with signature of informant and thereby filed said false suit on the basis of forged documents. The informant has never instructed present applicant and Adv. Sagar Suryawanshi for 2 O in BA No.42/19 CNR­MHPU01­000170­2019 filing the said suit, nor he has executed affidavits before Notary. He has not signed vakilpatra, but, his all the signatures are forced on so many documents and the said suit was filed. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5] The Ld. APP has brought to my notice that the applicant and others with force the signatures have filed say­ w.s. in the above numbered suit and thereby requested of grant for injunction in favour of plaintiff in that suit. According to him crores of rupees transactions and documents have been forged by the applicant and other co­ accused. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6] However, the applicant was arrested in this crime on 26.12.2018 and after P.C.R. from 27.12.2018 to 31.12.2018 she is in jail since 01.01.2019. In any case the record prima­facie does not show the breach of trust or fraud of crores of rupees cash by the applicant. Now even though the property or documents of lacs or crores of rupees are involved in the suit, but prima­facie at the most the role of applicant would be forgery of signatures on Vakilpatra, affidavit and other documents. The some of the documents are in the court. The police failed to recover any document from applicant during P.C.R. Therefore no purpose is going to be served by keeping the applicant behind the bar. She is having girl child of about one year and two­three months. Therefore, in my opinion it would be just and proper to grant bail to applicant on some conditions. Hence the order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER [1] The application (Exh.1) is allowed. [2] The applicant­accused Mrs Priyanka Dilip Shelar is released on bail in C.R. No.145/2018 registered with Shivajinagar police station, U/sec. 420, 465, 467, 468, 471 r/w 34 of Indian Penal Code, 1860 on furnishing of her P.B. and S.B. of Rs. 15000/­. 3 O in BA No.42/19 CNR­MHPU01­000170­2019 [3] She shall cooperate to the investigation and attend the concerned police station during day hours if called by I.O. in writing for the purpose of further investigation, if any.
