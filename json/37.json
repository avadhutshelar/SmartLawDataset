Respondent. \r\n---header-ends---\r\nORDER BELOW EXH.1 This is the first bail application by accused / applicant Mangesh Ambore under Section 439 of Criminal Procedure Code for regular bail, in connection with C.R.No.71/2014, registered by MIDC Bhosari police station, for the offence punishable under section 395 r/w 34 of IPC. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n[2] Perused the application and say given by the respondent at Exh.4. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[3] Heard learned advocate Mr. Ghogare for the applicant and APP Mr. Aurangabadkar for the respondent. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[4] Learned advocate Mr. Ghogare for the applicant argued that crime is of the year 2014 and accused was arrested recently. He is falsely implicated in the present crime. There is nothing on record to show that accused was absconding. In fact, accused had no knowledge that accused was booked in the present crime. There is no recovery at the instance of accused. By relying on the judgment of Hon\u0027ble Bombay High Court in the case of Mahipati Bapu Bandgar Vs. State of Maharashtra, 2002 ALL MR (Cri) 565, he submitted that fact of absconding would not itself disentitle the accused to get the bail. He further relied on another judgment of Hon\u0027ble Bombay High Court in the case of Deepak Charandas Bhatia Vs. State of Maharashtra, 2017(3) Bom. C. R. Cri.B.A.No.43/19 2 CNR No.MHPU01­000201­2019 (Cri.) 502 argued that during intervening period, the investigating agency neither arrested the applicant nor took steps for issuing proclamation and, therefore, it cannot be said that accused was absconding. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[5] The learned APP argued that the offence in question is serious. The test identification parade of the accused is to be taken. The accused was absconding and there is every likelihood that if he is released on bail, he will abscond. He prayed for rejection of the application. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[6] Admittedly, there is no recovery at the instance of accused in the present crime. The offence was registered against unknown person. The requirement of the accused for test identification parade cannot be the ground for rejecting the bail application. So far as the contention that accused was absconding, nothing is placed on record to show that investigating agency made any efforts to arrest the accused during intervening period or took steps for issuing proclamation. Under these circumstances, having regard to the nature of the offence and the fact that other co­ accused are already released on bail, I pass the following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER [1] The application is allowed. [2] The applicant Mangesh Sakharam Ambore is released on bail, on his executing PR Bond of Rs.15,000/­, with one surety of like amount, in connection with C.R.No. 71/2014, registered by MIDC Bhosari police station, Pune, on following conditions :­ [A] The applicant / accused shall not tamper with the Cri.B.A.No.43/19 3 CNR No.MHPU01­000201­2019 prosecution evidence in any manner.
