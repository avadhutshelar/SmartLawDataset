The State of Maharashtra ( Talegaon MIDC P.S.) \r\n---header-ends---\r\n[1] This is a first bail application under Section 439 of Cr.P.C. for the grant of bail to Applicants – Vishal Mohan Bhosale and Prakash Mohan Bhosale for the offences punishable under Section 307, 324, 504, 34 of IPC 4, 25 of Arms Act and u/s. 37(1) (3)/135 of Bombay Police Act in C.R. No. 129/2018 registered at Talegaon MIDC Police Station, District – Pune. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n[2] Perused the application and say filed by I.O. I have heard both the sides and perused the material placed on the record. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[3] Prosecution case in short is as under:­ On 06.12.2018 there was verbal dispute between complainant’s brother, Gorakh Ananta Bhosale and his cousin brother Vishal Bhosale, on account that, Vishal Bhosale Peeps in his brother’s house by seeing the women flock. On 07.12.2018 at about 03.00 p.m. when the complainant was proceeding for his work, he called his cousin brother Vishal Bhosale by his mobile phone to his cousin brother’s mobile and inquired about yesterday date incident. The complainant alleges that, his cousin brother abused him and challenged him to come home, so that, he shall see him and threatened the complainant. The complainant along with his brother Gorakh Bhosale went to the house of Vishal Bhosale at 03.10 p.m. At that time, Vishal Bhosale was standing in the door of house, by holding a sword in his hand . They both started speaking with each other and Vishal abused and started heating with sword to the complainant and his brother Gorakh. In this assault, he got a cut on left hand thumb and middle finger and his brother Gorakh received a cut wound on his right hand. While the scuffle was going on, Vishal’s brother Prakash Bhosale took the sword from Vishal and hit complainant’s brother and complainant by it and caused grievous injury. According to complainant, Vishal and Prakash also beat Tushar with sword. At that time, complainant’s other cousin brother Nitin Bhosale was also beaten by fist and leg blows. On these allegations, the accused was prosecuted. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[4] The Ld. Counsel for the Applicants submitted that, the applicants are innocent and is falsely implicated in this crime. The accused/applicant have not assaulted the complainant. In fact both the applicants are beaten up and assaulted by complainant Swapnil Bhosale and his three brothers I.e. Gorakh, Tushar, Nitin. They were prosecuted u/s. 326, 324,323, 504, 506 r/w. 34 of IPC vide C.R. No. 128/2018 dated 08.12.2018. This is a counter blast to the complaint filed by the applicants against the complainant and his brother. The applicants are in jail since 20.12.2018. Hence, the applicants are entitled to release them on bail. They are ready to co­operate with the investigating agency. They are ready to abide all the terms and conditions, which will be imposed by the Court. On these grounds, he prayed to release them on bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[5] On the other hand, the Ld. APP submitted that there is prima facie accusation against the applicants. If the applicants are released on bail, then they may tamper with the prosecution evidence. There is direct involvement of the accused in the alleged crime. The injured sustained grievous injury. There is statement of eye­witnesses. It is submitted that, looking to the gravity of the offence, the application is liable to be rejected. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[6] After considering this submission of both the sides and perusing the material placed on record, it reveals that there is counter complaint against the complainant and accused. The investigating papers shows that the injured received grievous injury. They are relative of each other. If the applicants be released on bail, then, they may tamper with the prosecution evidence. The investigation is in progress. The possibility of committing any other cognizable offence cannot be ruled out. Considering the gravity of the offence, it is not desirable at this juncture, to release the applicants on bail. Hence, I proceed to pass the following order :­ \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER Application (Exh.1) is rejected. \r\n---order-ends---\r\nSd/­ (G.P.Agrawal) Date : 25.01.2019 Additional Sessions Judge, Pune. : 4 : CERTIFICATE I affirm that the contents of this P.D.F. file order are same word to word as per original order.
