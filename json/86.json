Main accused Prajakta did not remain present in Hinjawadi Police Station in spite of notice under section 41(1)(a) of Cr.P.C. Applicants are originally resident of Dist­Nagar and it is necessary to investigate with them together. Applicants will pressurize victim and witnesses and there is possibility of tampering prosecution evidence and possibility of non­cooperating in investigation process. So, they prayed to reject the application. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5] From First Information Report and statement of victim role attributed to applicants can be gathered. As per statement of victim present applicants were asking him to do agricultural work, they used to beat him. Applicant no.1 i.e. his uncle was telling him to work in his shop and he was beating him if it was not properly done. He was also not providing meal to him.

About incident which took place before August­2017 report is filed on 19.11.2018. No specific date of incident with regard to present applicants is mentioned. In such circumstances, considering medical ground of applicant no.2 and allegations against both applicants, custodial interrogation with them is not required.

Statement of victim is already recorded. Statement of victim does not show that these applicants insisted him to hear words of main accused.
