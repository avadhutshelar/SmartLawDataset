(CNR­MHPU01­000804­2019 and CNR­MHPU01­000805) \r\n---header-ends---\r\n1] Applicants­Mukesh Ashok Gire, Vijay Tanaji Gavhane and Sandip Ashok Gore, Pankaj Bhatu Patil have filed this application for bail under section 439 of Cr.P.C. in connection with CR No.147/2018 of Ranjangaon Police Station under section 20 (B) of N.D.P.S. Act. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2] It is the case of prosecution that, on 22/12/2018 at 23.10 hours at Yash Inn Chowk, at Karegaon, Taluka­Shirur, District­Pune, these four applicants were found in possession of 2 kg. Ganja worth Rs.70,000/­ and other materials. Hence, on the complaint of complainant Police Naik Prafful Bhagat this offence was registered. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3] Advocate for the applicant in his argument stated that if the total quantity of seized Ganja is divided into four accused, the quantity of Ganja allegedly possessed by each accused is of small quantity of 500 Gram each. Therefore, bar under section 37 of NDPS Act is not attracted. In this context, reliance is placeed on unreported judgment of Bombay High Court in Cri. Appln. no.6416/2013 dated 24/12/2013 in case of Jagan Parshuram Chavan Vs. State of Maharashtra, 2004 ALL MR (Cri.) 635 and 2006 ALL MR (Cri) 2405. Investigation almost completed, only CA report is awaited. Therefore, further detention of the applicant 2 is not necessary. Hence, they may be relesaed on bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4] Ld. APP strongly opposed this application. It is his contention that investigation is not yet completed. Offence is serious. It is committed against society. That stock of Ganja was found possesed with an intention to sell it. If these applicants will be released on bail, they will flee away from justice and there is possibility of tampering the prosecution witnesses and evidence. Hence, this application may be rejected. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5] In Jagan Chavan case and Govind Prasad Burman case (Cited Supra) the quantity of Ganja found in possession of applicant was less than commercial quantity. Therefore, there was no question of application of bar of section 37 of NDPS Act. Therefore, in both those matters Hon\u0027ble High Court granted bail to the applicants. That ratio is squarely applicable to the present case. In Sangeeta Gaikwad\u0027s case Hon\u0027ble High Court held that merely from the fact that drug has been purchased from same person may not constitute independent evidence of criminal conspiracy. IO in his say to these applications did not mention any proper reason for further detention of these applicants. The stock of Ganja, vehicles used, vessels used for carrying Ganja are already seized. Nothing remained to be recovered and discovered from these applicants. Hence, I pass the following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER 1. Bail Application Nos.221/2019 and 222/2019 are allowed. 3 Bail application nos.221/2019 and 222/2019. 2. Applicants­Mukesh Ashok Gire, Vijay Tanaji Gavhane and Sandip Ashok Gore, Pankaj Bhatu Patil be released on bail in CR No.147/2018 of Ranjangaon Police Station under section 20 (B) of N.D.P.S.
