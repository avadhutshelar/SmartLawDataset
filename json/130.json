Prior to the present FIR, Informant has approached to police on 10/08/2018 and one N.C. came to be registered. But that time, she did not allege about ill­treatment or unnatural sex. Applicant has also filed one photocopy of the letter of Informant dated 31/10/2018, in which Informant has stated that, now the matter has been settled between them and decided that, mutual consent divorce will be obtained. Therefore, she was not pressing her application. As such, Applicant submit that, this entire proceeding is filed just to obtain mutual consent divorce. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5] Advocate for Applicant has relied upon following citations and contended that, for attracting offence punishable under Section 498­A of Indian Penal Code, the given parameters are to be shown. 1] Manju Ram Kalita Vs.

Hence, he prays for custody of the Applicant and rejection of the application. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n7] Learned Adv. M. T. Karche appeared for Informant. He submits that, Informant has given specific dates of ill­treatment and narrated the nature of incidents. MLC papers also prima facie, shown the injuries on Informant. Gold ornaments of Informant are also with Applicant. Therefore, recovery is pending against Applicant. Police did not entertain her FIR timely, therefore, there is delay in the FIR. He relied upon following citations and prays for rejection of the application. 1] Vikas Nassa Vs. State of Haryana, reported in 2016(3) RCR (Criminal) 613. 2] Sunny Soin Vs. State of Punjab, reported in 2013(7) RCR (Criminal) 35. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n8] Heard learned Adv. S. V. Kolhatkar for Applicant, learned Adv. M. T. Karche for Informant and learned APP.

The medical papers dated 10/08/2018 are placed on record and injuries in nature abrasion and contusion are shown on person of Informant. But prima facie, no major injury has been shown. Informant is also alleged about unnatural sex by Applicant. Investigation officer wants custody of the Applicant for his medical examination in this regard. But, Informant herself has stated that, as the incident is of August 2018 and more than three months period had been lapsed. She did not find medical examination necessary in this regard. In such situation, custody of the Applicant for medical examination is also not seen to be necessary. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n10] The facts in the aforesaid citations placed on record by Assistant to learned APP are different. Moreover, it is a discretionary relief and Court needs to consider facts and circumstances of each case independently. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n11] As such, prima facie, though investigation with the Applicant is necessary, applicant is having roots in the society and without any criminal antecedents. So, immediate custody of the Applicant is not necessary. By putting suitable conditions on Applicant, the purpose will be served. Hence, I prefer to pass following Order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER 1] Application is allowed. 2] Interim Order passed below Exh.4 on 09/01/2019 is hereby confirmed on same terms and conditions with following amended condition, [C] Applicant to attend Police Station, Sinhgad Road, Pune once in a week on every Thursday between 11.00 am. to 02.00 pm. till completion of investigation and filing of charge­sheet. 3] Intimate to concern Police Station. \r\n---order-ends---\r\nsd/­xxx Pune.
