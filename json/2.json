Respondent. \r\n---header-ends---\r\nORDER BELOW EXH.1 This is the first bail application under Section 439 of the Cr. P. C. in connection with C.R.No.72/2018, registered by Chikhali police station, for the offence punishable under section 435, 436 of the Indian Penal Code. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n[2] Perused the application and say given at Exh.3. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[3] Heard learned advocate Mr. Wajid Khan for the applicant / accused and APP Mr. Aurangabadkar for the respondent. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[4] The learned advocate for the applicant / accused argued that present applicant / accused is falsely implicated in the crime. The FIR is filed against unknown person. There is no eyewitness to the incident. Only because accused / applicant is from Madhya Pradesh and not knowing Marathi, the applicant is arrested to show that police had taken the action in the crime. He submitted that applicant has no criminal antecedent. They are ready to abide any condition imposed. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[5] The learned APP for respondent opposed the bail application and argued that the crime in question is serious in nature. The applicant has criminal antecedents. The possibility of tampering with the evidence cannot be ruled out. He also submitted that there is every likelihood that if applicant / accused is released on bail, he may abscond. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[6] I have gone through the FIR and investigation papers produced for my perusal. It is clear that in the FIR, the complaint is made against some unknown persons. There is no material on record at this stage prima ­facie to show the involvement of the applicant in the present crime, or to connect him with the present crime. There is no material to show that he had any motive to commit the offence in question. The only material is a letter issued to the Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Pimpri regarding adding Section 436 of the IPC, wherein it is mentioned that the accused / applicant had committed the crime. Having regard to the averment in the FIR, which is against the unknown person and the fact that the applicant / accused is arrested on 13­12­2018 and he is in jail since then, I find no further purpose would be served by keeping him in jail. So far as apprehension expressed by the prosecution, the care of the same can be taken by imposing necessary conditions. Hence, I pass the following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER [1] The application is allowed. [2] The applicant / accused Saddam Jabbar Shaikh is released on bail, on his executing PR Bond of Rs.20,000/­, with one or two sureties of like amount, in connection with C.R.No.72/2018, registered by Chikhali police station, on following conditions :­ [A] The applicant / accused shall not tamper with the prosecution evidence in any manner. [B] The applicant / accused shall attend Chikhali police Cri.B.A.No. 2/19 3 CNR No.MHPU01­017659­2019 station on every Wednesday from 10 a.m. to 12 noon, after his release from jail for next two months.
