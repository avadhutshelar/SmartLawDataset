No.24 of 2019. 01. \r\n---header-ends---\r\nThe applicants, namely, Ramesh Sudam Yampure (accused No.5), Ravindra Annaso Dhembare (accused No.7), Sanjay Dnyandeo Pawar (accused No.8), Dnyaneshwar Balu Kolekar (accused No.30) apprehending their arrest in C.R.No.457 of 2018 for the offences punishable under Sections 307, 353, 332, 333, 143, 147, 148, 149, 109, 120B, 504, 506 of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 37(1)(3) and 135 of the Bombay Police Act, registered with Phaltan City Police Station, have filed this application for anticipatory bail. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n02. Perused application and say of A.P.P. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n03. From the contents of complaint of Palvi Pramod Kale in C.R.No.457 of 2018, it reveals that, the alleged incident had taken place on 23.11.2018, at about 12.30 a.m. to 01.00 a.m. From the contents of complaint, it further reveals that, on 22.11.2018, Digambar Rohidas Agavne made conspiracy with his supporters / accused and told them that, he will consume poison or will make drama of consuming poison and told supporters to pelt stones in Phaltan City and Police Station. As per the conspiracy dated 22.11.2018 the alleged incident had been taken place on 23.11.2018 at about 12.30 a.m. to 01.00 a.m. Jayashri Digambar Agavne who is wife of Digambar Agavne were members of unlawful assembly and they pelted stones towards police and Police Station. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n04. According to applicants, they are falsely implicated on suspicion and they are having apprehension of arrest. They are permanent resident of addresses shown in the application. There is no direct or indirect evidence against them. Applicants are not having any previous criminal background. CoÂ­accused have been released on anticipatory bail by Hon\u0027ble High Court of Judicature at Bombay and rule of parity is applicable to present applicants. There is no need of personal interrogation. Investigation has been completed. Accused were not present on the spot on the date of alleged incident. No role of applicants is bifurcated in the FIR. Witnesses are Police Officers. Applicants are not seen in CCTV footage. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n05. From the say of learned A.P.P. at Exh.7, it reveals that, on 23.11.2018, during night applicants along with 50 to 60 persons attacked Phaltan City Police Station by proceeding from Giravi Naka. They pelted stones on the Police Officers, on Police Station and on vehicles. Police Officers were injured. Applicants damaged vehicles and created terror in the vicinity of Phaltan City. The CCTV footage and video recording shows positive participation of applicants in the crime. Applicants are not deserving for bail. If they are enlarged on bail, they will tamper prosecution evidence by their muscle and money power. Applicants are having political background. Digambar Agavne is prime conspirator and applicants are his supporters. Digambar Agavne had contested Assembly Election earlier. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n06. Heard learned Advocate for applicants and learned A.P.P. It is vehemently argued by learned Advocate for applicants that, their role is not bifurcated in FIR. The anticipatory bail are granted to the coÂ­accused. Some coÂ­ accused have been enlarged on regular bail. Witnesses are Police Officers. Personal interrogation of applicants is not necessary. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n07. Per contra, it is fairly argued by learned A.P.P. that, there are no direct allegations against accused Nos.5, 7, 8 and 30. Accused were members of unlawful assembly. Hon\u0027ble High Court has granted bail to accused Nos.15 to 17 and 24. Role of present applicants and accused who are granted anticipatory bail by Hon\u0027ble High Court is same. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n08. I have gone through the order of Hon\u0027ble High Court of Judicature at Bombay in Anticipatory Bail Applications No.2728 of 2018, 2715 of 2018, 2717 of 2018 dated 10.01.2019. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n09. Accused No.9 Umesh was applicant in Anticipatory Bail Application No.2728 of 2018. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n10. Accused, namely, Abhijit Tukaram Jadhav, Jotiba Khandu Bhujbal, Khanderao Dnyandeo Bhise were accused Nos.22, 24 and 4 respectively and they were applicants in Anticipatory Bail Application No.2715 of 2018. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n11.

Accused No.20 Nilesh was applicant in Anticipatory Bail Application No.147 of 2019. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n15. On 17.01.2019, order was passed by Hon\u0027ble High Court in Anticipatory Bail Application No.147 of 2019 and anticipatory bail was grated to accused No.20 Nilesh Telkhande on certain terms and conditions. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n16. It is fairly argued by learned A.P.P. that, there are no direct allegations against present applicants and their specific role is not shown in FIR. The anticipatory bail application of accused Nos.15 to 17 and 24 and other coÂ­accused was granted by Hon\u0027ble High Court. The role of present applicants i.e. accused Nos.5, 7, 8 and 30 and role of accused No.15 to 17 and 24 is same. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n17. On perusal of record it reveals that, accused No.15 to 17 and other accused have applied for anticipatory bail and their anticipatory bail application was granted on 10.01.2019 in Bail Application No.2718 of 2018. Record further indicates that, on 10.01.2019 anticipatory bail was granted to accused No.22, 24 and 4 in Anticipatory Bail Application No.2715 of 2018. Record further indicates that, anticipatory bail application of accused No.9 was granted in Anticipatory Bail Application No.2718 of 2018. Anticipatory bail application of accused No.20 is granted in Anticipatory Bail Application No.147 of 2019 by Hon\u0027ble High Court on 17.01.2019. The role of present applicants and of accused to whom anticipatory bail is granted by Hon\u0027ble High Court is same. There are no direct allegations against the applicants in the FIR. In my mind, considering the role of present applicants and the accused to whom anticipatory bail is granted by Hon\u0027ble High Court is same. Moreover, witnesses in present case are police witnesses to whom accused cannot pressurise. If it is so, then in my mind, final protection to present applicants needs to be granted on certain terms and conditions. In my mind considering the role of present applicants and the coÂ­accused to whom anticipatory bail was granted is same and, as such, the principle of parity can be applicable. Moreover, learned A.P.P. has no objection to grant final protection to applicants considering the role of present applicants and of accused to whom anticipatory bail is granted. Hence, I proceed to pass the following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nO R D E R 1. Application is allowed. 2. In the event of arrest of applicants, namely, Ramesh Sudam Yampure (accused No.5), Ravindra Annaso Dhembare (accused No.7), Sanjay Dnyandeo Pawar (accused No.8), Dnyaneshwar Balu Kolekar (accused No.30) in Crime Register No.457 of 2018, of Phaltan City Police Station, they be released on furnishing P.R. Bond of Rs.25,000/Â­ with two sureties each in like amount. 3. Till filing of the chargeÂ­sheet, applicants shall attend the Investigating Officer on every Wednesday and Saturday between 10.00 a.m. to 12.00 noon. 4. The applicants shall neither tamper the evidence of prosecution nor influence the witnesses and assist the Investigating Officer. \r\n---order-ends---\r\nSatara. Date : 29.01.2019. (N.D.Khose) Additional Sessions Judge, Satara."
