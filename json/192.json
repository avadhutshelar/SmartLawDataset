Name of the applicant does not figure in FIR. Co­accused Vyankatesh Mishra during remand has disclosed the name of the applicant. There is delay in complaint. Custody is not required. He has regularly attended Police Station. Lastly, he prayed for confirmation of ad­interim protection. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4] The learned Counsel Shri. Limbekar for the applicant Raj Borate has submitted that complainant has not submitted real facts. He has not come to the Court with clean hands. Prakash Gaidhane being a friend of complainant, introduced with other accused. Complainant is blackmailing the accused persons. As per complainant he has paid or deposited only Rs. 25 lakhs but more amount is received by him. Bail application of Vaikunth Mishra is granted by Hon\u0027ble High Court on deposit of Rs. 5.5 lakhs. He visited Investigating Officer for 3 to 4 times and helped the Investigating Officer in investigation. Complainant is threatening the accused persons.

Sawant for the original complainant submitted that the time was spent in filing complaint and prior to that regarding case under Sec. 138 of N.I. Act. There is active role of Barate. Gravity of the offence needs to be considered. Complainant is not a victim but his son who lost one year is a victim. It is cold blooded offence. Accused have admitted the crime. No parity is applicable. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n7] From the face of record, it can be gathered that complainant has paid / deposited Rs. 25 lakhs i.e., (9,00,000/­+14,000,00/­+ 2,00,000/­ \u003d 25 lakhs). Against the same complainant has received 16,90,000/­ + 3,40,000/­ + 5,50,000/­ (which is deposited by accused Mishra before Hon\u0027ble High Court) in Criminal Bail Appln No. 71/2019 dt. 16.01.2019. Besides, from the face of record it can be gathered that Mishra has received the amount in presence of the present applicant and they both were in the company of complainant time to time to visit  Shri. Mishra. There are no allegations of the complainant that the applicants have personally received any amount from complainant towards the admission of his son for M.B.B.S Course. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n8] Having considered the nature of offence and circumstances that most of the amount is received by the complainant against its deposit or payment.
