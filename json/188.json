  "processedText": "Bail application no. 262/2019 Order below Exh.01 in Bail Application No. 262/2019 (CNR­MHPU01­000903­2019) \r\n---header-ends---\r\n1] Applicant Latif @ Gaus Alisher Saudagar has filed this application for bail under section 439 of Cr.P.C. in connection with CR No. 335/2018 registered with Khadki Police Station, Pune, under sections 307, 387, 142, 147, 148, 149, 323, 504, 506 of IPC, under section 7 of Criminal Law Amendment Act and under section 37 (1) r/w. s.135 of Maharashtra Police Act. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2] It is the case of prosecution that, Complainant Sohail Tohit Qureshi filed complaint that when he was present in Gafoor Beef Shop with one labour Ayub Qureshi, this applicant along with others came there and demanded protection money (gIrk) of Rs.5,000/­ and beaten him by sickle, cement block, pipe and wooden log on account of his refusal to leave the premises. On the basis of that complaint, this offence came to be registered. This applicant was arrested on 10/10/2018. At present he is in MCR. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3] Advocate for applicant in his argument stated that the contents of complaint shows that there was dispute on account of premises of said shop. Thus, there was previous enmity. He further stated that it is impossible to believe that the Complainant ward of hitting of sickle thrown against him and hence blow of cement block was given on his head. Injury certificate shows simple injuries sustained. In Bail Application no.4816/2018 this court granted bail to one of the co­accused. Nothing remained to be 2 recovered or discovered from this applicant. Investigation is completed and charge sheet has been filed and it has been registered as RCC no.3/2019. Weapons are already recovered. The applicant is ready to obey the conditions of bail. Reliance is placed on case of Masoom Birham Tadvi Vs. State of Maharashtra (2004 (2) B Cr C 556). In that case investigation was completed and charge­sheet was also filed, therefore, Hon\u0027ble High Court observed that further detention of the applicant is not necessary. Lakhya @ Nikhil Prakash Kshirsagar Vs. The State of Maharashtra (2015 (1) B Cr C 450). That was a case under section 307 of IPC. Hon\u0027ble High Court observed that offence is not exclusively punishable with death or imprisonment for life. Investigation is completed and charge­sheet has been filed. Injured being out of danger and there is no gainful purpose in keeping the applicant behind the bar. In light of these legal principles, he prayed that this application may be allowed and applicant be released on bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4] Ld. APP strongly opposed this application. It is his contention that the applicant and his associates demanded ransom. It was the second incident, previously also they had terrorized him. They shouted and terrorized the persons of that vicinity. They hurled abuses against Complainant. The applicant tried to give blow of sickle on vital part of the body of Complainant. Thereafter, blows of cement block were given on his head with intention to kill him. Role of this applicant cannot be equated with co­accused who is already released on bail. Therefore, on the ground of parity he is 3 Bail application no. 262/2019 not entitled to be released on bail. Hence, this application may be rejected. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5] In this case, injured are already discharged from the hospital. Investigation is completed and chargesheet is also filed. Weapons are recovered. Nothing remained to be recovered or discovered from this applicant. The alleged offence is not exclusively punishable with death or life imprisonment. Injured being out of danger, there is no gainful purpose in keeping the applicant behind bar. Hence, I pass the following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER 1. Application is allowed. 2. Applicant­ Latif @ Gaus Alisher Saudagar be released on bail in CR No.335/2018 registered with Khadki Police Station, Pune, under sections 307, 387, 142, 147, 148, 149, 323, 504, 506 of IPC, under section 7 of Criminal Law Amendment Act and under section 37 (1) r/w. s.135 of Maharashtra Police Act, on furnishing PR bond of Rs. 25,000/­ (Rs.
