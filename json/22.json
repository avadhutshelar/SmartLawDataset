Mtrs. having survey no.146/1/A, 147, 141/2, Ekta Nagar, Pashan, Pune­21 was standing in the name of above said Sushila Atre as owner and possessor of it. She was mother of the Complainant. Before about 2­3 years this applicant and his wife Sou. Gauri Ghalsasi came to be acquainted with Complainant as real estate agent and they induced the Complainant to find good customers for their plot and obtained original copies of sale­deed of said plot, blank stamp paper of Rs.3/­ standing in the name of Madhavrao Atre, death certificate of Madhavrao Atre and Sushila Atre. Complainant repeatedly demanded that file and documents but the applicant and his wife gave false assurance; Due to his family difficulties, the Complainant obtained handloan of Rs.4,08,000/­ from the applicant Vaibhav and his wife and it was decided that after sale of plot, he would return that amount. While obtaining that amount Complainant had signed some receipts in respect of money taken. One day the Complainant visited that plot, he noticed that some people of MSEB were installing meter. When he objected, those people left that spot without fixing the meter. After some days the applicant and his wife got fitted the electric meter at the outer shed of the above mentioned plot. Complainant obtained that information under RTI Act from MSEB. The applicant and his wife misused above mentioned document and blank stamp paper of Rs.3/­ and executed sale­deed in the name of Kumari Gauri Dingankar, Age­18 years and by fabricating and forging the signatures of original Complainant, his father and mother obtained electric connection on the said plot. On that plot there are in all three tin sheds. The complainant has executed registered leave and license agreement with tenant Santosh Shah on 18/07/2018. The applicant and his wife are threatening the tenant in bad words. They obtained his thumb impression on laptop by taking him to Bhairobanath Mandir, Pashan for executing leave and license agreement with him. Therefore, on the complaint of Complainant, this offence came to be registered. Applicants are arrested on 14/12/2018.",

Sushila Atre deceased mother of Complainant had executed unregistered sale­deed dated 06/10/1988 in favour of Gauri Dhingaskar. Complainant and his father Madhavrao Atre gave consent to the said sale­deed. Complainant is an expert person in sale and purchase transactions. Due to above said family relationship, Vaibhav and his wife kept faith on Complainant and for further necessary compliance said original documents were kept in custody of Complainant for obtaining N.A. permission, for inserting name of applicant in 7/12 extract and other revenue record, for measurement etc of that plot. Complainant had obtained huge amount from them time to time on the pretext of expenses for the said work but he failed to make assured legal compliances. Complainant along with Nikhil Govitkar and Sudhir Advaind started misuse of that property. Therefore, Vaibhav Ghalsasi and his wife demanded back their original documents from the Complainant but instead of returning those documents the Complainant started blackmailing and threatening the Vaibhav and his wife that he got executed the Will of his deceased mother in his favour and he is owner of that property and obtained huge amount of Rs.4,08,000/­ by cheque, cash and RTGS from the account of Vaibhav and his wife. By twisting the fact he has filed this false complaint. Mrs. Gauri has already filed caveat application in the court of Civil Judge, Sr. Divn. and served its notice to Complainant and above stated two persons and thereafter this complaint came to be filed. Ld. JMFC rejected the bail application of this applicant on the ground that investigation is pending. Chargesheet is not yet filed. The said plot is in possession of Gauri and electric meter installed there standing in her name. As per the principle of part performance Gauri and her husband are in possession of that plot. Complainant has suppressed all these facts in his complaint and tried to mislead the police. Further detention of applicants is not necessary. Hence, they may be released on bail.",

(CNR NO.­MHPU01­000060­2019 \u0026 MHPU01­017630­2018) \r\n---header-ends---\r\n1] Applicants­Vaibhav Madhusudan Ghalsasi and Sou. Gauri Vaibhav Ghalsasi @ Dingankar have filed these applications for bail under section 439 of Cr.P.C. in connection with CR No.598/2018 registered with Chaturshrungi Police Station, Pune, under sections 420, 406, 467, 468, 471 r/w. S.34 of IPC. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2] It is the case of prosecution that, One Sushil Madhavrao Atre died on 03/08/1989. Thereafer her husband Mr. Madhavrao Atre died on 05/05/1991. Plot admeasuring 300 Sq. Mtrs. having survey no.146/1/A, 147, 141/2, Ekta Nagar, Pashan, Pune­21 was standing in the name of above said Sushila Atre as owner and possessor of it. She was mother of the Complainant. Before about 2­3 years this applicant and his wife Sou. Gauri Ghalsasi came to be acquainted with Complainant as real estate agent and they induced the Complainant to find good customers for their plot and obtained original copies of sale­deed of said plot, blank stamp paper of Rs.3/­ standing in the name of Madhavrao Atre, death certificate of Madhavrao Atre and Sushila Atre. Complainant repeatedly demanded that file and documents but the applicant and his wife gave false assurance; Due to his family difficulties, the Complainant obtained handloan of Rs.4,08,000/­ from the applicant Vaibhav and his wife and it was decided that after sale of plot, he would return that amount. While obtaining that amount Complainant had signed some receipts in respect of money taken. One day the Complainant visited that plot, he noticed that some people of MSEB were installing meter. When he objected, those people left that spot without fixing the meter. After some days the applicant and his wife got fitted the electric meter at the outer shed of the above mentioned plot. Complainant obtained that information under RTI Act from MSEB. The applicant and his wife misused above mentioned document and blank stamp paper of Rs.3/­ and executed sale­deed in the name of Kumari Gauri Dingankar, Age­18 years and by fabricating and forging the signatures of original Complainant, his father and mother obtained electric connection on the said plot. On that plot there are in all three tin sheds. The complainant has executed registered leave and license agreement with tenant Santosh Shah on 18/07/2018. The applicant and his wife are threatening the tenant in bad words. They obtained his thumb impression on laptop by taking him to Bhairobanath Mandir, Pashan for executing leave and license agreement with him. Therefore, on the complaint of Complainant, this offence came to be registered. Applicants are arrested on 14/12/2018. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3] Advocate for the applicants in his argument stated that Mr. Vaibhav Ghalsasi and Gauri Ghalsasi are husband and wife. Both of them are arrested in connection with this crime. Maiden name of Gauri is Gauri Dingankar. Atre family and Dingankar family are well acquainted with each other and having good relations from last many decades. Smt. Sushila Atre deceased mother of Complainant had executed unregistered sale­deed dated 06/10/1988 in favour of Gauri Dhingaskar. Complainant and his father Madhavrao Atre gave consent to the said sale­deed. Complainant is an expert person in sale and purchase transactions. Due to above said family relationship, Vaibhav and his wife kept faith on Complainant and for further necessary compliance said original documents were kept in custody of Complainant for obtaining N.A. permission, for inserting name of applicant in 7/12 extract and other revenue record, for measurement etc of that plot. Complainant had obtained huge amount from them time to time on the pretext of expenses for the said work but he failed to make assured legal compliances. Complainant along with Nikhil Govitkar and Sudhir Advaind started misuse of that property. Therefore, Vaibhav Ghalsasi and his wife demanded back their original documents from the Complainant but instead of returning those documents the Complainant started blackmailing and threatening the Vaibhav and his wife that he got executed the Will of his deceased mother in his favour and he is owner of that property and obtained huge amount of Rs.4,08,000/­ by cheque, cash and RTGS from the account of Vaibhav and his wife. By twisting the fact he has filed this false complaint. Mrs. Gauri has already filed caveat application in the court of Civil Judge, Sr. Divn. and served its notice to Complainant and above stated two persons and thereafter this complaint came to be filed. Ld. JMFC rejected the bail application of this applicant on the ground that investigation is pending. Chargesheet is not yet filed. The said plot is in possession of Gauri and electric meter installed there standing in her name. As per the principle of part performance Gauri and her husband are in possession of that plot. Complainant has suppressed all these facts in his complaint and tried to mislead the police. Further detention of applicants is not necessary. Hence, they may be released on bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4] Ld. DGP strongly opposed this application. It is her contention that investigation is not yet completed. Offence is serious. If applicant will be released on bail, there is possibility of tampering prosecution witnesses and evidence. She further informed that blank stamp paper of Rs.3/­ was found uploaded in the laptop of Vaibhav Ghalsasi with intention to prepare false and forged document. Thus, there is prima facie evidence against Vaibhav. Hence, this application may be rejected. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5] Copy of unregistered sale­deed executed in favour of Gauri Santosh Digankar by Sushila Atre is produced on record. To that document Madhavrao Atre and Sushila Atre were consenting party and in that capacity it was signed by them. The applicants have deposited duty of unstamped document of Rs.16,200/­ and penalty of Rs.64,800/­. Copies of those two challans are filed on record. The above said sale­deed was typed on stamp paper of Rs.3/­. This document clearly shows that real dispute between the parties seems to be different than what shown in the complaint. Custodial interrogation of the applicant is already over. Nothing remained to be recovered or discovered from the applicants. Considering the nature of offence and allegations, further detention of the applicants is not necessary. Hence, I pass the following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER 1. Bail Application Nos.23/2019 and 5471/2018 are allowed. 2. Applicants Vaibhav Madhusudan Ghalsasi and Sou. Gauri Vaibhav Ghalsasi @ Dingankar be released on bail in connection with CR No.598/2018 registered with Chaturshrungi Police Station, Pune, under sections 420, 406, 467, 468, 471 r/w. S.34 of IPC, on furnishing PR bond of Rs. 25,000/­ (Rs. Twenty Five thousand only) with one or two sureties in like amount each. 3. They shall not tamper with any prosecution witnesses and evidence. 4. Copy of this common order be kept in Cri. Bail Appln. no.5471/2018. 5. Bail before Ld. Magistrate. \r\n---order-ends---\r\nSd/­ ( S. S. Gosavi ) Date : 18­01­2019 Additional Sessions Judge, Pune.
