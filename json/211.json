    "text": "ORDER BELOW EXH.01 IN CRI. BAIL APPLN. NO. 11/2019 This is an application for anticipatory bail as per section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Heard advocate Mr. Inamdar for applicant. He submitted that Crime No. 102/2018 is registered against this applicant with Khandala Police Station for the offences punishable under sections 354 and 354­A of the Indian Penal Code. But applicant is totally innocent. The FIR seems to have been lodged by the informant/prosecutrix out of misunderstanding. Incident as alleged in the FIR was unlikely to happen in the running ST bus of the Corporation and especially when applicant was traveling along­with his minor son. If the alleged incident really would have taken place then the informant immediately should have approached the nearest police station. But she did not do so. She has lodged false FIR at the last destination of said bus i.e. at Shirdi.",

  "processedText": "1/4 Criminal Bail Application No. 11/2019 Mr. Manjunath Swamy B. N. Vs. State of Maharashtra CNR­MHST010000119­2019 \r\n---header-ends---\r\nORDER BELOW EXH.01 IN CRI. BAIL APPLN. NO. 11/2019 This is an application for anticipatory bail as per section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Heard advocate Mr. Inamdar for applicant. He submitted that Crime No. 102/2018 is registered against this applicant with Khandala Police Station for the offences punishable under sections 354 and 354­A of the Indian Penal Code. But applicant is totally innocent. The FIR seems to have been lodged by the informant/prosecutrix out of misunderstanding. Incident as alleged in the FIR was unlikely to happen in the running ST bus of the Corporation and especially when applicant was traveling along­with his minor son. If the alleged incident really would have taken place then the informant immediately should have approached the nearest police station. But she did not do so. She has lodged false FIR at the last destination of said bus i.e. at Shirdi. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2. He further submitted that applicant is the person having reputation in the society. The police for the time and again are searching him for arrest. If he is arrested then his reputation is likely to be maligned. There is nothing which is to be seized from him. He is ready to obey with all the conditions those may be imposed upon him and is also ready to co­operate with investigation. Therefore he prayed that by imposing certain conditions, applicant may be released on bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3. APP Mrs. Diwakar by filing her say at Exh.4 strongly resisted the application. She replied that applicant along­with his son was sitting on the backside seats of the informant/prosecutrix in the said S.T. bus. At about 6.00 p.m. on 14/06/2018 he gave hard pushes to the seat of the informant. When she expressed her displeasure, he apologized and the matter was ended there. However, after 12.00 midnight and on 15/06/2018 in the dark, applicant by inserting his hand from backside, he moved it on the stomach and breast of the informant. She raised shouts. The bus was stopped and applicant along­with son got down the bus and fled away in the dark. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4. She further replied that the informant being lady and being permanent resident of Bangalore, she could not lodge the FIR at night time and she lodged it after the bus reached the last destination i.e. Shirdi. It is also revealed during the course of investigation that the applicant has picturized the informant and that shooting is to be seized from him. Applicant and informant both are residents of Bangalore. Therefore if he is granted pre­ arrest protection then he is likely to threaten the informant and witnesses. Investigation is in progress. On all these grounds, she submitted that application may be rejected. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5. Advocate Mr. Inamdar replied that the story of picturization of informant is not finding its place in the FIR. It goes to show that informant has stated colourful story to the police and she has exaggerated it. Applicant is innocent. Therefore he prayed that applicant may be granted pre­arrest protection. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6. After going through the FIR lodged by informant/ prosecutrix, it is seen that she is permanent resident of Bangalore and she used to be alone in the house. She is Social Worker. On 14/06/2018 she boarded in Airawat A/C Club Bus of KSRTC bearing No. KA­57/F­1822 from Bangalore to Shirdi. When the bus reached at Belgaum at about 6.00 p.m., applicant gave forceful pushes to her seat. When she asked its account to him, he apologized. At about 00.10 hours, the lights in the bus were switched off and all the passengers went asleep. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n7. Taking undue advantage of the dark, applicant inserted his right hand from the side of window and moved it on her beast and stomach and thereby insulted her modesty. When she raised shouts, the lights were put on. The bus was halted. But applicant fled away along­with his son by getting down the bus. After the bus reached Shirdi, she lodged the FIR against applicant and by 00 number it came to be transferred to Khandala Police Station. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n8. From the FIR, it is also seen that there is reason to believe that alleged incident has really taken place. It is important to note that at about 6.00 p.m. of 14/06/2018 also applicant gave forceful pushes to her seat, but she kept mum. But when he insulted her modesty in the dark at 00.10 a.m. on 15/06/2018, she raised alarm. This incident is witnessed by the bus conductor and other passengers. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n9. Considering the nature and seriousness of accusation, applicant does not deserve to get the pre­arrest protection. Because informant is also resident of Bangalore and she used to be alone in the house. Under such circumstances, he is likely to threaten and pressurize her and witnesses from disclosing the truth to the Court. During the course of investigation, it is also revealed that applicant has picturized the informant. That shooting is also to be seized from him. As such his custodial interrogation is certainly warranted. If pre­arrest protection is granted to applicant then entire investigation would be paralyzed. Therefore this is not the fit case to grant pre­arrest protection to applicant. Hence the order follows :­ \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER Application is rejected. \r\n---order-ends---\r\n(Order is dictated and pronounced in the open Court) Satara (R.D.Deshpande) Dt.24/01/2019. Additional Sessions Judge, Satara."
