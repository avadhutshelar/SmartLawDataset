He further submitted that applicant/accused has committed similar type of offence, therefore, his bail application be rejected. On perusing record, prima faice, it reveals that on the basis of report lodged by complainant, crime No.44/2009 came to be registered at Vadgaon Maval Police station on 08/03/2009. Moreover in the FIR, it is alleged that on 08/03/2009, complainant was driving the truck, which was loaded with iron pipe and proceeding from Mumbai to Pune, at that time, in the vicinity of Vadgaon Maval, some people arrived by white colour jeep, obstructed his truck and by giving threat to him, kidnapped him, snatched his mobile, cash amount and other documents, and thereafter, with impugned loaded truck, fled away from the spot of incident, thereby committed offence punishable u/s. 395 of the Indian Penal Code. It appears that charge sheet against co­accused is also filed by Investigating officer. Moreover, Investigating officer has arrested to present applicant/accused on 15/11/2018. Co­accused are already released on bail. Prima facie, it reveals that custodial interrogation of the present applicant is now not necessary. Therefore, considering all these aspects, in my view if present applicant ­accused is released on bail on certain conditions, no prejudice will be caused to the prosecution. Hence, I pass the following order.",

  "processedText": "CNR No.MHPU01­000313­2019 Indaz Nabab Khan @ Pandit @ Chunni Vs. State of Maharashtra (Vadgaon Maval Police Station ) \r\n---header-ends---\r\nOrder below exh. 1 in Cri. Bail application No..117/2109 1. This is an application U/s.439 of Cr.P.C. filed by the applicant­accused for grant of bail in connection with Crime No.44/2009 , registered with Vadgaon Maval Police Station for the offence punishable u/s.395, 363, 411 r/w.s34 of IPC. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2. Prosecution case is that on 08/03/2009 at about 04 a.am., complainant­Yuvraj Gade along with his truck was proceeding from Mumbai to Pune, and when his truck within the vicinity of Wadgaon Maval, one Qualis jeep by overtaking the truck, came in frontof said truck, three persons alighted from the said jeep, and pulled out complainant from the truck, beat him and snatched his mobile phone, cash amount and other documents worth Rs.5,59,883/­ and also kidnapped him, thereafter, along with truck,fled away. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3. Learned counsel for applicant/accused submitted that applicant/accused has not committed any offence and he has been falsely implicated in this offence. He further submitted that section 395 of IPC is not attracted. He further submitted that in the FIR, age of unknown accused persons is mentioned in between 20 to 25 years, however, present applicant/accused is 55 years old. He further submitted that investigation is completed, therefore, custodial interrogation of the applicant/accused is not necessary. He further submitted that if applicant/accused is released on bail, no prejudice will cause to other side. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4. On other hand, learned APP submitted that offence alleged against applicant/accused is serious in nature. He further submitted that if applicant/accused is released on bail, he will again commit similar type of offence. He further submitted that applicant/accused is absconding since last many years, if he released on bail, he will again abscond. He further submitted that applicant/accused has committed similar type of offence, therefore, his bail application be rejected. On perusing record, prima faice, it reveals that on the basis of report lodged by complainant, crime No.44/2009 came to be registered at Vadgaon Maval Police station on 08/03/2009. Moreover in the FIR, it is alleged that on 08/03/2009, complainant was driving the truck, which was loaded with iron pipe and proceeding from Mumbai to Pune, at that time, in the vicinity of Vadgaon Maval, some people arrived by white colour jeep, obstructed his truck and by giving threat to him, kidnapped him, snatched his mobile, cash amount and other documents, and thereafter, with impugned loaded truck, fled away from the spot of incident, thereby committed offence punishable u/s. 395 of the Indian Penal Code. It appears that charge sheet against co­accused is also filed by Investigating officer. Moreover, Investigating officer has arrested to present applicant/accused on 15/11/2018. Co­accused are already released on bail. Prima facie, it reveals that custodial interrogation of the present applicant is now not necessary. Therefore, considering all these aspects, in my view if present applicant ­accused is released on bail on certain conditions, no prejudice will be caused to the prosecution. Hence, I pass the following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER i. Application is allowed. ii. The applicant­accused ­ Indaz Nabab Khan @ Pandit @ Chunni be released on bail on furnishing P.R. Bond of Rs.1,00,000/­ (Rupees 3 one lakh Only) with solvent surety in like amount. iii. The applicant ­accused shall not tamper with prosecution evidence. iv.
