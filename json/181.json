  "processedText": " CNR­MHPU01­000802­2019 COMMON ORDER BELOW EXH.1 IN CRIMINAL BAIL APPLN NO. 138/2019 and 252/2019 Perused the bail application of Mangesh @ Bhajya Sanjay Pawar and second bail application of Kumar @ Kumya Balkrushna Khude and say thereon. \r\n---header-ends---\r\nHeard the learned Advocate Shri. Sachin P.Kumbhar for both the applicants/ accused and APP Shri. Salvi for the State. 2] It is the case of the Prosecution that on 14.11.2018 at about 1.50 at Naravir Tanaji Wadi, Pune applicant along with co­accused were found in possession of the incriminating articles and they were in preparation of committing dacoity at Nakoda Jwellers. Thereby, committed an offence punishable under Sec/s. 399, 402 of Indian Penal Code, 37(1)/ 135 of Maharashtra Police Act and under Section 4/25 of the Arms Act, which registered as CR No. 331/2018 with Pharaskhana Police Station. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n3] The learned Counsel for the applicants submitted that co­accused Shubham is released on bail in Criminal Bail Appln. No. 5441/2018. Investigation is completed and charge sheet is filed. Mere recovery is not sufficient to hold that the accused have prepared for committing dacoity. Previous bail application of Kumar Khude is rejected as investigation was not completed. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4] Learned APP submitted as per their say. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5] Co­accused is released on bail. Investigation is completed and charge sheet is filed. Nothing is to be recovered or discovered from the applicants. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6] Kumar Khude seems to be habitual offender. Six cases are pending against him, however, there is no document to show that he is convicted in any of the case. Merely because cases are pending against Kumar, is not a ground to reject his bail application, if he is otherwise, entitled for bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n7] Having considered the fact and circumstances of the case, further custody of the applicants is not required. Hence, order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER 1] Both criminal bail applications i.e., 138/2019 and 252/2019 of Mangesh @ Bhajya Sanjay Pawar and of Kumar @ Kumya Balkrushna Khude are hereby allowed. 2] Accused Mangesh @ Bhajya Sanjay Pawar and of Kumar @ Kumya Balkrushna Khude be enlarged on PR Bond of Rs. 20,000/­ each with one or two sureties each in like amount on following conditions. 1] They shall remain present before the Court on each and every date for facing trial. 2] They shall not tamper the prosecution evidence and they shall maintain peace in the society. 3] They shall not commit any other or further offence. 4] Applicant Kumar @ Kumya Balkrushna Khude shall visit concerned police station on first Monday of each month during 3.00 p.m. to 5.00 p.m to Investigating Officer till trial is over. 5] In default any of the condition bail shall automatically forfeited to the Government without notice to the accused. 6] Copy of this order be attached with Criminal Bail Appln No. 252/2019. 3] Bail before concerned Court. \r\n---order-ends---\r\nsd/­­­­­­ Pune.
