It further appears that accused threw stones at police and obstructed the police while performing their duty and also injured the police by using wooden stick and pelting stones. It further appears that accused caused damage to the public and private property. During investigation weapons used in the crime are recovered from the spot of incident. Injured police Ashok Nawale, Sachin Bhagwat, Balu Sawant and Patil and two home-guards were discharged from the hospital. Perusal of injury certificate, it appears that there are no chances of converting the offences in to grievous one. Substantive investigation is already completed. There is no any specific role has stated by the complainant against the accused. It is not the case of the prosecution that there are many criminal antecedents pending against the accused.

  "processedText": "Bail Appln.No. 93/2019 CNR-MHPU01-000359-2019 \r\n---header-ends---\r\nORDER BELOW EXH. 1 1. This is an application under Sec. 439 of Cr.P.C. for grant of bail pending trial. Thereafter, on the basis of the report lodged by P.S.I.Manoj Mohan Pawar C.R.No. 333/2018 under Sec. 143, 147, 148, 149, 151, 152, 160, 188, 323, 324, 325, 332, 333, 336, 337, 353, 427 of I.P.C., Sec. 3 of Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act, Sec. 37(1)(3), 135 of Bombay Police Act, 4(25) of Arms Act was registered. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2. Facts of the prosecution case are that; last year one criminal Subhan Shaikh was murdered, who was staying in Parshi Chawl Zopatpatti. Therefore, accused i.e. friends of deceased were celebrating birthday of deceased. The supporters of the said deceased criminal wanted to demonstrate their power to the Parshi Chawl slum. Accused and their relatives to show the power of crime mafia in the city on 25.05.2018 at night between 10.30 to 11.00 p.m. accused No. 1 to 55 and other 25 to 30 unknown accused came with arms to Savana Chowk, Dehuroad, Pune on motorcycles and walking. The collector had already issued prohibitory orders to collect at one place with arms. However, accused persons gathered there and violated the said order by carrying wooden stick, stones in their hands and committed riot. Thereafter, police were trying to control, the accused pushed the police, threw stones at police and also accused injured the police with simple and grievous hurt. Prosecution further alleged that accused damage to the public and private property and caused injury to each other. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3. By this application applicant accused contends that he has been falsely implicated in the crime. No specific role is stated in the F.I.R. There is no recovery or discovery of incriminating articles at the hands of applicant. Co-accused are released on bail, therefore, on the ground party he is entitled for bail. Applicant is not resident of Parshi Chal, Dehuroad therefore there is no motive or intention to commit alleged offence. Applicant is not support of deceased Subhan Shaikh. Investigation of the crime is completed practically and only formality of filing of charge-sheet is remained. He is the only earning member of his family. Applicant is ready to abide the conditions imposed by the court. Thus, applicant has prayed for grant of bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4. In response to the show cause notice, prosecution has filed its vide Exh. 3 and denied all adverse allegations and reiterated its case. It is contended that remaining accused are yet to be arrested. Offence is serious and investigation is in progress. Accused will pressurize the panch and witnesses. On these lines prosecution has prayed for rejection of the application. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5. Heard learned counsel for the applicant and Ld.A.P.P. for the prosecution. Perused case diary and case papers provided by the prosecution. There are grounds for believing that accusation is well founded against the accused. As per the story of the prosecution before one year one Subhan Shaikh was murdered and his date of birth was celebrated by his supporters i.e. accused in order to create terror in Parshi Chawl. It further appears that the accused persons violated the prohibitory order issued by Collector and committed riot. It further appears that accused threw stones at police and obstructed the police while performing their duty and also injured the police by using wooden stick and pelting stones. It further appears that accused caused damage to the public and private property. During investigation weapons used in the crime are recovered from the spot of incident. Injured police Ashok Nawale, Sachin Bhagwat, Balu Sawant and Patil and two home-guards were discharged from the hospital. Perusal of injury certificate, it appears that there are no chances of converting the offences in to grievous one. Substantive investigation is already completed. There is no any specific role has stated by the complainant against the accused. It is not the case of the prosecution that there are many criminal antecedents pending against the accused. I am of the opinion that pertaining to the present applicant accused substantive investigation is already completed. Therefore, considering the nature of offence, applicant can be released on bail by imposing certain terms and conditions. With this I proceed to pass the following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nO R D E R 1. Cri.Bail Appln. No. 93/2019 is hereby allowed. 2. Applicant Ajay Laxman Mhetre in C.R.No. 333/2018 registered with Dehuroad Police Station, be released on bail upon furnishing P.R.Bond in the sum of Rs. 25,000/- with one or two solvent sureties in the like amount. 3. He shall attend the concerned police station whenever directed by the I.O. in writing and co-operate the investigating officer in further investigation. 4. He shall not directly or indirectly make any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of this case. 5. If the applicant committed breach of any conditions, the prosecution is at liberty to approach this court for cancellation of the bail. \r\n---order-ends---\r\n( S. H.
