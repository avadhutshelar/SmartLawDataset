  "processedText": "Criminal Bail Application No.103/2019 CNR NO. MHPU01­000450­2019 Vanita Ganpat Patil …. Applicant. Vs. State of Maharashtra …. Respondent. \r\n---header-ends---\r\nORDER BELOW EXH.1 This is an application filed by the applicant under Section 438 of the Criminal Procedure Code in C.R.No.668/2018, registered by Chaturshringi Police Station under Section 406, 420, 467, 471 r/w 34 of the Indian Penal Code. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n[2] Perused the say given by the respondent. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[3] Heard learned advocate Mr. Swami for the applicant / accused and learned APP Mr. Aurangabadkar for the respondent. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[4] Learned advocate Mr. Swami for the applicant argued that as per the FIR, it is alleged that the applicant and her husband made false representation with the finance company and availed loan more than the price of the machinery they purchased. It is alleged that the applicant and her husband had forged the documents, cheated the complainant and submitted forged documents to show that they had paid 20 % of the price to the concerned company and obtained more loan, utilized the said amount for their own use, committed default in payment of EMIs. The learned advocate argued that though the applicant is the proprietor of the firm, the entire business of the firm was looked after by her husband Ganpat Patil, who is already arrested by the police and needful documents are already recovered by the police and, therefore, there is no need of custodial interrogation of the applicant / accused and her application may be allowed for anticipatory bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[5] Per­contra, learned APP for the State argued that the firm is the proprietary firm and, the applicant was the proprietor of the firm. She had accompanied her husband when the alleged false representation was made. She had every knowledge and she had played active role in commission of the crime. He prayed for rejection of the application. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[6] Prima­facie, from the investigation papers produced for my perusal, it is clear that the accused / applicant is the proprietor of the Mahalaxmi Industries and she along with her husband Ganpat Patil, made false representation, quoted price of the machine to be purchased as Rs.82,60,000/­, whereas they purchased the machine amounting to Rs.47,60,922/­. As per the policy of the company, the finance company had asked the applicant and her husband to deposit 20 % of the price of the machine with the seller and accused / applicant with her husband fabricated the documents and submitted bogus documents suggesting that they had deposited Rs.20,60,000/­ with the seller. The submission of the learned advocate for the applicant / accused cannot be accepted that the applicant was not aware of the transaction and the entire business was being looked after by her husband. Admittedly, she is the proprietor of the company. She cannot avoid the responsibility of the said transaction. Having regard to the nature of the offence and the grounds put forth by respondent in their say while praying for rejection of the application, I find that for proper investigation the custodial interrogation of the applicant / accused is necessary. Hence, I pass the following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER The application is rejected. \r\n---order-ends---\r\nPune, Dated/­ 17­01­2019 ( Aniruddha Y. Thatte ) Additional Sessions Judge, Pune. I affirm that the contents of the PDF file Judgment are same word for word as per original Judgment. Name of Steno :­ Shri. V. V.
