(CNR NO.­MHPU01­000515­2019 \u0026 MHPU01­000586­2019) \r\n---header-ends---\r\n1] Applicants­Umesh Kashinath Sonawane, Dinesh Kashinath Sonawane, Dashrath Kondiba Shinde and Yogendra Raghunath Khistre have filed these applications for bail under section 439 of Cr.P.C. in connection with CR No.707/2018 registered with Bhosari Police Station, Pune, under sections 420, 464, 465, 467, 468, 471 r/w. S.34 of IPC. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2] It is the case of prosecution that, Vignaharta Promoters and Builders is a partnership firm of Complainant, Nitin Atmaram More and Deepak Patil. Complainant lodged complaint against three unknown persons that taking undue advantage of name of his partners Deepak Patil and Nitin More and their pan cards those persons made false and forged signaturres and without any authority to sell flats belonging to said partnership firm sold flats of that firm and on these flats raised loan of Rs. One Crore from Indian Home Loan Company and accused no.3 Parag had opened account with Ganesh Co­operative Bank and transferred that loan amount in various bank accounts and mis­appropriated the loan amount and cheated and committed forgery of valuable security. Hence, Complainant­Jagannath Shephal lodged complaint. Accordingly, this offence came to be registered. Accused nos.1, 2, and 5 were arrested on 22/12/2018 and accused no.4 was arrested on 20/12/2018. Initialy, they were remadned in PC. Now they are in MCR. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3] Advocate for applicants in his argument stated that all offences are triable by JMFC. They are not punishable with death or life imprisonment. Names of applicants are not mentioned in the FIR. They have not caused wrongful loss to the Complainant. Complainant was not benefited in the said transaction. The concerned bank / financial institution did not file any complaint against them. Amount was transferred in the account of Mr. Bachuwar. Only on the basis of inadmissible confessional statement given to the police by another accused, these applicants were arrested on suspicious. Investigation is completed. Further detention of the applicants is not necessary. Hence, they may be released on bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4] Ld. DGP strongly opposed this application. It is her contention that these accused committed forgery in respect of valuable securities. They had executed sale­deeds of those flats in favour of third person and raised loan against that flats. When online search was taken, this fact was revealed. Accused nos.1 and 2 Umesh and Dashrath were remained present and pretended themselves to be owner of that flat at the time of execution of this false and fabricated sale­deeds. Those title deeds were deposited and loan was raised. Accused no.3 Parag Kulkarni opened the bank account with Ganesh Co­operative Bank and siphoned and transferred the loan amount and these applicants mis­appropriated that amount. Investigation is not yet completed. These applicants. will be released on bail, there is possibility of tampering the prosecution witnesses and evidence. Hence, these applications be rejected. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5] The offence is serious. By doing cheating by personnation. False and forged valuable securities were executed. Those forged documents were used as genuine for raising loan amount. After raising loan amount of huge amount, it was siphoned / transferred in various accounts and mis­appropriated. That amount is not yet recovered. Investigation is not yet completed. At this juncture, if this applicant will be released on bail, further investigation will hamper and possibility of tampering prosecution witnesses cannot be ruled out. Hence, I pass the following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER 1] Bail Application Nos.125/2019 and 161/2019 are rejected. 2] Copy of this order be kept in Bail Appln. no.161/2019. \r\n---order-ends---\r\nSd/­ ( S.
