  "processedText": "Order below Exh. 3 in Cri. Bail Application No.108/2019 :- \r\n---header-ends---\r\nThis is an application for grant of ad interim anticipatory bail under section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, for the offence punishable under section 306 of the Indian Penal Code in crime No. 6/19 registered with Sinhagad Road police station, Pune. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2] The prosecution case in short is that the complainant Vinod Jagdish Wagh lodged complaint with Sinhagad Road police station inter alia contending that on 17-12-2018, he realized that his wife Aditi was in disturbed mood and hence he asked her about the same. That time, she told that one Ashish Dhiwar is blackmailing her. She further told that during Ganesh festival, his wife Aditi used to go with son Parth at Dhol Pathak. That time, she got acquainted with one Ashish Dhiwar. Thereafter, by giving some assurance he used to roam with her and snapped some photographs. Thereafter said Ashish threatened her about said photographs and kept physical relations with her and also demanded money. On 21-1- 2018, complainant told her that he will resolve said matter and went to office. In afternoon, Aditi consumed poison and she was vomiting. On these allegations, complainant lodged report and offence punishable under section 306 2 of IPC came to be registered against the accused vide crime No.6/19. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3] Heard Advocate Shri. M.J. Nimbalkar for the applicant. Perused documentary evidence placed on record. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4] The learned counsel of applicant vehemently argued that the present accused has not committed any offence as alleged and he has been falsely implicated on suspicion. There is no iota of evidence against the applicant. The custody of the applicant is not at all required for investigation. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5] It is specifically argued by learned counsel of applicant that applicant is innocent and he has not committed any offence as alleged and therefore he is entitled for the relief of ad interim anticipatory bail. The learned counsel for accused has placed his reliance in case of Madan Mohan Singh Vs. State of Gujarat and another, 2010 BHCCO 3219, Somnath s/o. Ashok Darekar Vs. The State of Maharashtra \u0026 Anr., 2018 ALL MR (Cri) 290 and Dilip s/o. Ramrao Shrasao \u0026 Ors. Vs. State of Maharashtra \u0026 Anr., 2016 ALL MR (Cri) 4328. 3 \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6] On perusal of the copy of F.I.R., it appears that the complainant has made specific allegations that the accused that he was blackmailing deceased, he had kept physical relations with her and abetted her to commit suicide. Prima facie involvement of the applicant in the offence in question appears. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n7] Considering the allegations made in the F.I.R. and considering the gravity of the offence, it cannot be said that custodial interrogation of the applicant is not necessary. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n8] Considering these facts together, considering the allegations made in the F.I.R. and considering the nature and gravity of the offence alleged to have been committed by the applicant, the authorities cited on behalf of the accused are not helpful to him at this prima facie stage. Therefore, I am of the view that this is not a fit case to grant ad interim anticipatory bail to the applicant. Hence, the following order :- \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER The application is rejected. ( Mrs. M.M. Deshpande) Date: 7-1-2019. Additional Sessions Judge, Pune. 4 5 Order below Exh. 1 in Cri. Bail Application No. 108/2019 :- In view of rejection of application Exh.3, this application does not survive.
