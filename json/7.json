Hence, on the complaint of Pravin Shirke, API of Anti­Narcotic Cell, Pune, this offence was registered. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3] Advocate for the applicant in his argument stated that even as per the case of prosecution, the quantity of Ganja found in possession of applicant is less than commercial quantity. This applicant is no way concern with the accused no.2. He has not committed any offence punishable under NDPS Act. This applicant has not found in possession of other contraband articles. It is search and seizure case and investigation of the case is totally completed. Therefore, custody of the applicant is unwarranted. Therefore, this application may be released on bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4] Ld. APP strongly opposed this application. It is his 2 contention that investigation is not yet completed. Offence is serious. That stock of Ganja was found possesed with an intention to sell it. If this applicant will be released on bail, he will flee away from justice and there is possibility of tampering the prosecution witnesses and evidence. Hence, this application may be rejected. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5] Advocate for the applicant in his argument placed reliance on unreported judgment of Hon\u0027ble High Court Bench at Aurangabad in Cri. Application no.1865/2017 in which in para no.2 Hon\u0027ble High Court observed that the quantity of Ganja involved in that case was 10.572 kg. It is less than commercial quantity.

The ratio laid down in that case is squarely applicable to the present case as the quantity involved is less than commercial quantity. There is no bar under section 37 of NDPS Act.
