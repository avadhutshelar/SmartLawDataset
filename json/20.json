Moreover, police papers show that police have already seized bricks from the spot of incident. It appears that custodial interrogation of the applicant/accused is not necessary. Therefore, considering all these aspects, in my view if present applicant­ accused is released on bail on certain conditions, no prejudice will be caused to the prosecution. Hence, I pass the following order.",

Bail application No.21/2019 1. This is an application U/s.439 of Cr.P.C. filed by the applicant­accused for grant of bail in connection with Crime No.418/2018, registered with Haveli Police Station for the offence punishable u/s.307, 143, 147, 148, 149, 323, 504, 506 r/w.s 34 of IPC. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2. Prosecution case is that on 22/12/2018 at about 10­30 p.m., near Dhangar wasti, Om Sweet Panshop, village­ Nanded, applicant/accused along with other co­accused assaulted on complainant­Arvind Prajapati with iron rod, wooden log,brick and caused grievous hurt to him with intent to commit his murder. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3. Learned counsel for the applicant/accused submitted that applicant/accused has not committed any offence and he has been falsely implicated in this offence. He further submitted that incident occurred on 22/12/2018 but FIR came to be registered on24/12/2018. He further submitted that applicant/accused has not beaten to injured. He further submitted that nothing has been seized from the custody of applicant/accused. He further submitted that there is allegation against applicant/accused about he beat to injured by brick on his back, which is not on vital part of body. He further submitted that practically investigation is completed, therefore, applicant be released on bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4. On the other hand, learned APP submitted that name of applicant/accused as assailant is disclosed in the statement of complainant as well as witnesses. He further submitted that as alleged offence committed by accused Nos. 1 to 7, in furtherance of their common intention, therefore, role played by present applicant/accused cannot be separated at this stage. He further submitted that if applicant/accused is released on bail, he will pressurize complainant and prosecution witnesses. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5. On perusing police papers, prima facie, it reveals that on 23/12/2018 at 23.48 hours, statement of complainant came to be recorded at Sassoon hospital, in which, it is alleged that on the count that he has demanded cost of cigarette to accused ­Shubham Pawar, therefore, he called to other accused and assaulted on him by iron rod, wooden log and bricks etc. It appears that there are allegations against the present applicant/accused about he beat to complainant by brick. Moreover, police papers show that police have already seized bricks from the spot of incident. It appears that custodial interrogation of the applicant/accused is not necessary. Therefore, considering all these aspects, in my view if present applicant­ accused is released on bail on certain conditions, no prejudice will be caused to the prosecution. Hence, I pass the following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER i. Application is allowed. ii. The applicant ­accused ­Dashrath @ Lakhan Madhukar Bhutte, be released on bail on furnishing P.R. Bond of Rs.25,000/­ (Rupees Twenty five Thousand Only) with one or two solvent sureties in like amount. iii. The applicant­ accused shall not tamper with prosecution evidence. iv.
