  "processedText": "CNR No.MHPUO1­000918­2019 Dr. Amol Ashok Holkunde Vs. The State of Maharashtra ( Khadki Police Station) Order below Exh. 1 in Cri. Bail Application No.268/2019 \r\n---header-ends---\r\n1. The applicant­ accused has filed present application for anticipatory bail u/s.438 of Cr.P.C. in connection with C.R. No. 21/2019 registered with Khadki Police Station for the offences punishable u/s.468, 471 r/w.s.34 of the Indian Penal Code. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2. Prosecution case is that applicant/accused is husband of complainant­ Yogita Holkunde and they have jointly purchased flat No.14, Building No.B­3­ Green Field Society, Ajemera, Pimpri, Pune for Rs.35,50,000/­ by obtaining joint loan of Rs.25,50,000/­ from HDFC Bank, and thereafter by making top up loan, obtained loan amount of Rs. 7 lakh from India Bulls Finance Limited. As there was domestic dispute took place between complainant and applicant/accused, therefore, applicant/accused started to reside separately. Thereafter, complainant came to know that applicant/accused in collusion with other accused by making her fake signature on loan papers, obtained loam amount of Rs.45,50,000/­. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3. Learned counsel for applicant/accused submitted that applicant/accused has not committed any offence and he has been falsely implicated in this case. He further submitted that prior to registration of present crime, another crime bearing No.1052/2018 for offence punishable u/s. 498­A, 506(2) r/ws. 34 of the IPC came to be registered on the same allegations and in which, anticipatory bail was granted to applicant/accused. He further submitted that till today, applicant/accused paid EMI on the said loan, and complainant 2 herself is residing in the said flat with daughter, therefore, there is no wrongful gain on the part of applicant/accused. He further submitted that applicant/accused has not committed any forgery therefore, his custodial interrogation is not necessary. He is ready to give specimen signature to Investigating officer. He further submitted that there is no criminal antecedent against applicant/accused, therefore, he be released on anticipatory bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4. On the other hand, learned APP submitted that present applicant/accused in collusion with other accused while obtaining loan, made fake signatures of complainant and utilized loan amount of Rs.40,50,000/­, and thereby cheated to complainant and bank. He further submitted the Investigating is yet to be completed, therefore, anticipatory bail be rejected. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5. On perusing police papers prima facie, it reveals that applicant/accused is husband of complainant and their marriage came to be performed on 29/05/2011 and from the wedlock, they have one daughter. Moreover, it appears that one crime No.1052/2018 for the offences punishable u/s. 498­A and 506(2) etc of IPC is also registered against the applicant/accused and others, on the basis of report lodged by complainant at Pimpri Police. Moreover, from the complaint, it reveals that while purchasing impugned flat, applicant/accused obtained joint loan in the joint account of himself and his wife i.e. complainant by making fake signature of his wife. Moreover, it appears that applicant/accused is depositing EMO of the said loan amount. In such circumstances, custodial interrogation of the applicant ­accused is not necessary. Investigating officer can call at any time to applicant­ accused for taking his specimen signature and handwriting. Moreover, it appears that applicant/accused is doctor by profession, therefore, possibility of absconding of applicant/accused 3 does not arise. Therefore, in my view by imposing some conditions i.e. attending the Police Station and to cooperate the Investigating Officer in the investigation, if the present applicant­ accused is released on anticipatory bail, no prejudice will be caused to the prosecution. Hence, application deserves to be allowed. Therefore, I pass the following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nOrder i. Application is allowed. ii. In the event of arrest of applicant­ accused­ Amol Ashok Holkunde, he be released on anticipatory bail on furnishing P.R. Bond in a sum of Rs.25,000/­ (Rs. Twenty five thousand only), with one or two solvent sureties in the like amount. iii. The applicant­ accused shall attend concerned Police Station on every Monday between 11 a.m. to 2 p.m and also as and when required by the Investigating Officer and shall co­operate with the Investigation Agency till filing of charge sheet. iv. The applicant­ accused shall not tamper with prosecution evidence. v. The applicant­ accused shall not leave India without permission of the Court. \r\n---order-ends---\r\nDate : 24/01/2019 (K.D.Vadane) Additional Sessions Judge, Pune. 4 “I affirm that the contents of the PDF file order are same word to word as per original judgment.” Name of Steno : Shri S.
