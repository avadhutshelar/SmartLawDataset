  "processedText": "ORDER BELOW EXH. 1 IN CRI. BAIL APPLICATION No. 23/2019 (Shivaji Dashrath Sonwalkar and anr. Vs. State of Maharashtra) CNR : MHST01­001942­2019 \r\n---header-ends---\r\n1) Present bail application is preferred by the applicants under section 439 of Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 seeking their release from arrest under C.R. no. 212/2018 registered at Phaltan Rural Police Station at the instance of Kantabai Balkrishna Sonwalkar, for alleged commission of offences punishable under sections 302, 143 \u0026 147 of Indian Penal Code, 1860. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2) It is contended that, no offence is committed as alleged. It is contended that, incident arose on spur of a moment. Accused and the informant are neighbours, there is no previous enmity between both these families. Allegations are of assaults by fist and kick blows. No weapon, stick or any other article is used. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3) Accused\u0027s advocate argued that, Runda and Lilabai if present at the spot at the time of occurrence, would have objected the accused from carrying victim to the hospital. Injury near eye cannot be reason for death. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4) It is contended that, cause of death was as due to spleenic injury, but spleen injury cannot be possible by fist or kick blows. Accused were never responsible for victim\u0027s spleenic injury. Accused took the injured Balkrishna to the hospital, he was suffering from alcoholic liver disease causing the death. Accused did not give victim\u0027s false medical history. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5) Applicant\u0027s advocate also contended that, the bonafides of applicant can be seen from the fact of having taken Balkrishna to the hospital immediately after the incidence. Placing reliance on an order dated 10/01/2019 passed by Hon\u0027ble High Court Bombay in Criminal Bail Application no. 2864 of 2018 preferred by co­accused Ganesh Dattatray Sonwalkar, it is contended that, accused did not harbour intention of murder. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6) It is further contended that, previous bail applications were rejected on grounds of pending investigation and differentiating the roles of these accused with the then bailed co­ accused Vaishali, Swati and Reshma. Other accused Ganesh being attributed similar role is enlarged on bail by Hon\u0027ble High Court in bail application no. 2864 of 2018; therefore these accused are also entitled to be released on bail on grounds of parity. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n7) Bail application is resisted by the APP by filing say at Exh. 7 on the grounds that, earlier bail applications preferred by these accused are rejected on merits, hence present bail application is not maintainable at all. Accused and victim are close relatives. Applicant\u0027s role is transpired in investigation. They have assaulted the victim with fist and kick blows on a trivial dispute of digging ditches in the fields. Accused took the victim to the hospital and gave wrong medical history to the doctor, before victim\u0027s family members reached the hospital. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n8) APP further contended that, even otherwise accused\u0027s case of victim\u0027s death due to the alcoholic liver is false. Victim\u0027s death is caused due to shock due to spleen injury, caused due to the assaults done by accused. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n9) Balkrishna suffered 3 to 4 fracture injuries, caused by the assaults inflicted by the accused. APP further contended that, accused and the victims being near relatives and neighbours, a male member already having lost his life, releasing the accused on bail may lead to pressurizing the witness and the informant, tampering the evidence cannot be ruled out. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n10) APP further contended that the role attributed to the present applicants is different from that of the female accused already enlarged on bail. Accordingly, it is contended for bail application to be rejected. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n11) Upon hearing both the advocates, perusing the papers submitted on record, it appears that, the incident alleged in FIR arose due to trivial reason of digging ditches in the fields. Proximity of the accused and the victim\u0027s family is undisputed. Allegations are of having assaulted by fist and kick blows. FIR also states of present accused having taken victim to the hospital. Prima­facie, it appears of the victim\u0027s family having reached the hospital after the victim was taken by the accused to the hospital. Victim\u0027s death is allegedly preceded by the incidents of assaults by the accused. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n12) Investigation being completed, charge­sheet is filed. Record reveals that, earlier bail application was rejected on the prime reason of investigation being continuing and these accused\u0027s role differing with that of the female accused. However, the role attributed to these accused is similar to that of accused Ganesh, enlarged on bail, vide Hon\u0027ble High Court\u0027s order, stated above. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n13) Thus, taking into consideration the entire circumstances, also the fact that the ladies accused enlarged on bail by this Court and Ganesh being enlarged on bail vide Hon\u0027ble High Court\u0027s order, it appears that, these accused can claim parity to be enlarged on bail. Even investigation being completed, charge­sheet being filed. But, it is uncertain as to the time to be consumed for the trial to initiate and to conclude. In such circumstances, it does not appear that, any purpose can be achieved by proper for these accused arrested pending the trial. At the same time, APP\u0027s apprehensions are also required to be considered. Hence, the following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nO R D E R 1) Criminal Bail Application no. 23/2019, is allowed. 2) Applicant no. 1 Shivaji Dashrath Sonwalkar and no. 2 Dattatray Dashrath Sonwalkar, be released on bail from their arrest under C.R. no. 212/2018 registered at Phaltan Rural Police Station on their furnishing personal bond of Rs. 50,000/­ each (Rs. Fifty Thousand each) with two solvent sureties, to make up the bond amount, on following terms and conditions; a) Applicants shall not tamper with evidence. b) Applicants shall not directly or indirectly make any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the case so as to dissuade him from disclosing such facts to the court or to any Police Officer. c) They shall not enter the village Wadle, Tal. Phaltan, Dist. Satara and shall give their alternate addresses of availability and also provide their operative mobile numbers to the Investigating Officer and the Court. d) Any default of above conditions shall be ground for cancellation of bail. e) Compliance before concerned Court. \r\n---order-ends---\r\n(Y.
