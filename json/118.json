By its Inspector of Police (Criminal Appeal No.1550/2018 arising out of SLP(Cri.)382 of 2016),2) Anil Chagan Yalmar Vs. State of Maharashtra (Anticipatory bail Appln No.1920 of 2018 (Hon\u0027ble High Court Bombay ) and 3) Shrikant L. Kalokhe Vs. The State of Maharashtra ( Anticipatory Bail No.1092 of 2018 ( Hon\u0027ble High Court at Bombay, bench at Aurangabad) . \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4. On the other hand, learned APP submitted that the suicide note was found in the possession of deceased shows that present applicant/accused and co­accused have harassed to deceased on count of demand of interest on hand loan amount, and also threatened to kill him, therefore, deceased committed suicide. He further submitted that as husband of complainant committed suicide, therefore, mental condition of complainant and other family members were not good, therefore, after completion of necessary rituals, she has lodged report at police station. He further submitted that there is sufficient material collected by Investigating officer to show involvement of present applicant/accused in alleged commission of offence, therefore, his custodial interrogation is necessary. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5. On perusing police papers, prima facie, it reveals that on 30/12/2018, Radhika Mahamuni – widow of deceased lodged report at Sinhgad road police station, alleging in that the applicant/accused and other co­accused have threatened and harassed her husband on count of refund of hand loan amount with interest, therefore, deceased has committed suicide. Moreover, suicide chit found in the pocket of deceased shows that deceased had taken hand loan from present applicant/accused and other co­accused, but subsequently, present applicant/accused and other co­accused made demand on interest on hand loan amount, and on that count, they have threatened to kill deceased and also sent boys to the house of deceased in order to beat him, therefore, deceased has committed suicide. Thus, from the contents of suicide note, it is crystal clear that as present applicant/accused and other accused have threatened to kill to deceased and boys sent to his house to beat him, therefore, he committed suicide. Moreover, it appears that impugned suicide note has seized by Investigating officer. Complainant being widow after completion of rituals, she has lodged report to police station. Thus, prima facie, there is sufficient material on record to show involvement of present applicant/accused in the alleged commission of offence. Moreover, as per police report, it seems that applicant/accused is absconding since occurrence of offence. Moreover, it appears that if applicant/accused is released on bail, there is possibility that he will tamper the prosecution evidence. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6. Supra cases on which, learned advocate for applicant/accused is relied are not applicable to the facts and circumstance in the case in hand. In the case in hand, in suicide note, there is specific allegations against present applicant/accused about they have threatened to kill to deceased, therefore, supra cases are not applicable to the case in hand. Taking into consideration all these facts and circumstances, in my view, applicant­ accused is not entitled to be released on anticipatory bail at this stage. Hence, application deserves to be rejected. Hence, I pass following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nOrder i. Application is rejected. \r\n---order-ends---\r\nDate :­24/01/2019 (K.D.Vadane) Additional Sessions Judge, Pune. 4 “I affirm that the contents of the PDF file Order are same word to word as per original judgment.” Name of Steno : Shri S.
