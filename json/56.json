State of Maharashtra \r\n---header-ends---\r\nORDER BELOW EXH. 4 1] This is an application for Ad­interim Anticipatory Bail under Section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in respect of Crime No. 284/2018 registered under Sections 354, 353, 323, 504, 506 read with Section 34 of Indian Penal Code at Police Station, Kamshet, Tal. Maval Dist. Pune. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2] Informant Manda Balu Mandekar has alleged that, she works as Anganwadi Assistant. Applicant No. 3 Somnath has lodged one report against her husband Balu Mandekar and brother Nitin Kedari and his associates for committing murder of one Kiran Korde. Therefore, due to fear, she did not resume duties for two months. On 14/11/2018 when she went to Anganwadi and was working, Applicants came there and forcefully tried to close the door of school. That time, Applicant pulled her Saree and had given her slaps. Therefore, she lodged the report. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3] Applicants submit that, present FIR is nothing but a counter blast of FIR lodged by Applicant no. 3 Somnath against husband and relatives of Informant. No such incident had happened. Very vague allegations have been made. In fact, Anganwadi School is regularly working and presently also it is working. Therefore, there is no merit in the contention of Informant. There is no immediate recovery. They are important witnesses in the counter FIR. Therefore, to harass them, this FIR has been lodged. As such, they pray for interim protection. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4] Heard advocate Shri. D. S. Bhoite for Applicants. Perused FIR and Papers. 5] Applicants have filed the copy of FIR No. 155/2018, as well as copy of the charge­sheet of this crime, in which Applicant No. 3 is Informant and rest of the Applicants are witnesses. Husband of Informant, namely, Balu Mandekar is accused in that FIR. In such situation, possibility of counter blast cannot be ruled out. Moreover, prima facie, allegations are about using of force to Informant with intention to outrage her modesty. But, no immediate recovery is seen. If interim protection is not granted, the purpose of filing of main application will be frustrated. Hence, I prefer to pass following Order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER 1] Application is allowed. 2] Pending herein final disposal of main application, in the event of arrest in Crime No.284/2018 registered under Sections 354, 353, 323, 504, 506 read with Section 34 of Indian Penal Code at Police Station, Kamshet, Tal.
