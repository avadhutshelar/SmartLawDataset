  "processedText": "Cri.Bail Application no. 91/2019 CNR No. MHPU01-000366-2019 \r\n---header-ends---\r\nORDER BELOW EXH.1 1] Perused application and say. Heard Advocate for applicant and APP for the State. 2] This is first bail application filed under section 439 of Cr.P.C. by applicant in respect of his arrest in C.R. no. 133/17 registered at Bibwewadi Police Station for the offence punishable under section 363,376(n) of the Indian Penal Code and under section 3,4,5(j),2(l),6 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. It is alleged that father of victim aged about 17 years lodged report of her missing. During investigation and after recording statement of victim, it revealed that victim and applicant were acquainted with each other. There was love affair between them. In 2016 her father lodged report of missing against applicant and applicant was arrested. In December­2016 applicant was released on bail and they started meeting each other. Applicant asked victim that they would marry with each other. On 26.04.2017 she went with applicant at Swargate bus stop and wandered at Sarasbaug. On 27.04.2017 they both went to Madha, Dist­ Solapur and resided in a room. They garland each other at Madheshwari temple and applicant wore marriage string to her and then committed sexual intercourse with her. She became pregnant and delivered baby boy on 19.02.2018. When she became 18 years old they performed marriage at Alandi Devachi as per Hindu rites and customs. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n3] According to applicant he is falsely implicated in this matter. It is a case of love affair . Applicant and victim married and out of wedlock they have baby boy who is 8 months old. Family members of applicant are depending on him. He is permanently residing at Bibwewadi, Pune. He has no criminal antecedents. He is ready to abide the conditions. Hence, he prayed to release him on bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4] APP and I.O. objected this application on the ground that investigation is in progress. Statement of victim under section 164 of Cr.P.C. is yet not recorded. Applicant will pressurize victim and witnesses. There is possibility of tampering prosecution evidence. So, they prayed to reject the application. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5] Allegations against the applicant are serious. Applicant is sufficiently interrogated. From statement of victim role attributed to applicant can be gathered. It revealed that due to love affair victim and applicant went away and resided at Madha, Dist­Solapur. They garland each other and performed marriage and resided in a room. They have 8 months boy. After becoming major their marriage was performed at Devachi Alandi. While residing at Madha, Dist­Solapur act of sexual intercourse was committed by applicant with victim. Victim is about 17 years old, applicant is 21 years old. Victim has attended age of sufficient maturity and knows the consequences of act. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6] In this context it is necessary to rely on authority cited in Sunil Mahadev Patil Vs. State of Maharashtra reported in 2016 All MR (Cri.) 1712, in which it is observed that if statement of prosecutrix and witnesses shows that they were in love relationship with each other they eloped and went to temple and performed marriage, they started residing together in the house of relative then there are mitigating circumstances. Moreover, it is observed that factor i.e. age of prosecutrix, whether act is violent, whether there are antecedents or not, whether offender is capable of repeating the act or not, whether there is likelihood of threats or intimidation if at all the boy is released, whether chance of tampering with material witnesses and age of the applicant and his employment and plan, stabilize and secure his future are to be taken into consideration while deciding bail application, when boy and minor girl are in love with each other. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n7] Ratio laid down in above cited ruling is noted. Victim never complained since beginning. It prima ­facie revealed that she herself left the house and went with applicant due to love affair . She delivered boy child and they were residing together after performing marriage when she attained majority. These are mitigating circumstances. Moreover, investigation is practically over. Personal custody of applicant is not required. He has no criminal antecedents. His family members are depending on him. No purpose would serve by keeping the applicant behind bar for unknown period. Due to all above reasons application deserves to be allowed with following order ­ \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER 1] The application is allowed. 2] The applicant Pandurang @ Sahil Bapu Kamble be released on executing P.R. bond of Rs.20,000/­ with one or two solvent sureties in the like amount. 3] The applicant shall not tamper the prosecution witnesses in any manner. 4] The applicant shall attend Bibwewadi Police Station on every Monday between 11.00 a.m. to 2.00 p.m. till the charge­sheet is filed. 5] The applicant shall not harass, threat and pressurize the victim. 6] The applicant shall co­operate investigating machinery as and when required. 7] Prior to furnishing surety, the applicant shall submit his address proof, mobile number and inform about the change in address and mobile number. \r\n---order-ends---\r\nPune.
