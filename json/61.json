Still he suppressed this fact from the complainant and deceived her and when she refused to marry, he assaulted her and threatened that he will upload her obscene photographs on Whats App and Face Book. Moreover, the accused has uploaded obscene photographs on Face Book and Whats App of her friends and relatives. The contents of FIR further clearly reveal that the accused has deceived the complainant and has kept physical relations with her under the false promise of marriage. The medical certificate also reveals that there is evidence of vaginal penetration. The charge is already filed. The matter will be committed soon. Trial will commence soon. Prima facie involvement of the accused appears in the offence in question. The apprehension of the prosecution is well founded from the act of the accused person. Considering these facts and considering the nature and gravity of offence and the role played by the accused in the offence in question, I am of the view that this is not a fit case to exhaust judicial discretion of bail. Therefore, it is not just and desirable to release the applicant/accused on bail. Hence, following order is passed.",

  "processedText": "Cri. B.A. No.72/19. Cri. Bail Application No. 72/2019 Shrikant Raju Shinde Vs. State. (CNR â€“ MHPU01 - 000259 -2018) \r\n---header-ends---\r\nOrder below Exh.1 (Passed on this 17th day of January, 2019) This is an application under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, for grant of bail to the applicant/accused for the offences punishable under Sections 376, 341, 420, 323, 504 and 506 of the Indian Penal Code and under section 67 of the Information Technology Act in Crime No.103/2018, registered with Uttam Nagar Police Station, Pune. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2] The prosecution case, in short, is that the complainant Rashmi Vijay Nikam lodged report to the police station Uttam Nagar inter alia contending that from July 2017 to 20-8-2018 the accused developed friendship with the complainant and proposed her for marriage, but the complainant refused to marry him. Later on, the accused took the complainant at Laxmi Garden, flat No.502, Shivane and gave her injection of drug and when she became unconscious, the accused committed sexual intercourse with her. Therefore, the complainant decided to marry him. The accused has committed forcible sexual intercourse with her at various places under the false promise of marriage. Prior to one month, complainant came to know that the accused is already married and he has a daughter. When the complainant made enquiry with him about it, the accused abused her and beat her and threatened that he will defame her by uploading her photographs on Whats App and Face Book. The accused has also uploaded her obscene photographs to her friends and relatives. The sister of accused namely Madhura was keeping watch on the complainant and she has helped accused in commission of crime. On these allegations, report is lodged and offence punishable under sections 376, 341, 420, 323, 504 and 506 of the Indian Penal Code and under section 67 of the Information Technology Act came to be registered against the accused vide crime No. 103/18. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3] The contention of the applicant/accused is that he is innocent and has not committed any offence. He has been falsely implicated in this case. He belongs to good and respectable family. There are no criminal antecedents against him. He is permanent resident of Pune. He is the only bread winner of his family. He is ready to abide by the terms and conditions that may be imposed by this Court. Lastly, he prayed to release him on bail.\r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4] The learned A.P.P. has opposed the application by filing say at Exh.3 on the ground that the accused is of cruel nature. If he is released on bail, he will pressurize complainant and witnesses, he will abscond and he will commit similar type of offence. Lastly, he prayed to reject the application. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5] Heard learned A.P.P. for the State. Heard learned Advocate for accused. Gone through the record. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6] In view of these facts, following points arise for determination and findings thereon are recorded against each of them, for the reasons stated below : Points Findings 1. Whether the accused is entitled for bail ? No. 2. What order ? As per final order. REASONS Point No.1 :- \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n7] On perusal of contents of F.I.R., it clearly reveals that the accused and complainant were acquainted with each other and their marriage was finalized. It appears from the contents of FIR that under the false promise of marriage, the accused developed friendship with the complainant and showed that he fell in love with her and committed forcible sexual intercourse with her by giving drug injection to her and prepared its video clip and again took her to the flat and under the false promise of marriage with her committed sexual intercourse with her and took her obscene photographs. The accused is already married and having a daughter. Still he suppressed this fact from the complainant and deceived her and when she refused to marry, he assaulted her and threatened that he will upload her obscene photographs on Whats App and Face Book. Moreover, the accused has uploaded obscene photographs on Face Book and Whats App of her friends and relatives. The contents of FIR further clearly reveal that the accused has deceived the complainant and has kept physical relations with her under the false promise of marriage. The medical certificate also reveals that there is evidence of vaginal penetration. The charge is already filed. The matter will be committed soon. Trial will commence soon. Prima facie involvement of the accused appears in the offence in question. The apprehension of the prosecution is well founded from the act of the accused person. Considering these facts and considering the nature and gravity of offence and the role played by the accused in the offence in question, I am of the view that this is not a fit case to exhaust judicial discretion of bail. Therefore, it is not just and desirable to release the applicant/accused on bail. Hence, following order is passed. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER Application (Exh.1) stands rejected. \r\n---order-ends---\r\n(Mrs. M.M.
