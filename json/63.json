Bail application No. 74/2018 1. This is an application U/s.439 of Cr.P.C. filed by the applicants­accused for grant of bail in connection with Crime No.08/2019, registered with Paud Police Station for the offence punishable u/s.7 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2. Applicant/accused No.1 who is Talathi and applicant/accused No.2, who is also Government servant, made demand of bribe amount to the original complainant, therefore, he contacted to ACB, Pune, who by following due procedure, caught to the applicant/accused Nos. 1 and 2, while accepting bribe amount of Rs.50,000/­. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3. Learned counsel for applicants/accused submitted that practically investigation is completed, therefore, custodial interrogation of the applicants/accused is not necessary. Therefore, they be released on bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4. On the other hand, learned APP submitted that investigation is yet to be completed and if applicants/accused are released on bail, there is possibility of tampering the prosecution evidence. Therefore, bail application be rejected. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5. On perusing police papers, prima facie, it reveals that applicant/accused No.1 is Talathi of Bhugaon. She made demand of bribe amount to the original complainant for mutation of entry, therefore, complainant contacted to ACB, Pune, who carried raid and caught the applicant/accused Nos. 1 and 2 while accepting bribe amount of Rs.50,000/­. It seems that practically investigation is 2 completed, therefore, custodial interrogation of the applicant/accused is now not necessary, Therefore, considering all these aspects, in my view if present applicants­ accused are released on bail on certain conditions, no prejudice will be caused to the prosecution. Hence, I pass the following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER i. Application is allowed. ii. The applicants ­accused No.1­Manisha Sarjerao Pawar and No.2­ Vitthal Gulab Surve, be released on bail on furnishing P.R.
