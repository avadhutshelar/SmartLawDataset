No.303/2015 registered with Dattawadi Police Station for the offences punishable u/s. 406 r/w.s 34 of the Indian Penal Code. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2 Prosecution case is that applicant/accused by giving false promise to complainant about giving good returns on depositing amount with Shriramcity Union Finance, Omisha Chit Funds, S. J. Trinity Finance Ltd., obtained DDs from the complainant, however, in spite of depositing amount of said DDs, used the said amount for his own use, and thereby cheated to the complainant. Moreover, applicant/accused along with other co­accused, in furtherance of their common intention, given some returns to the complainant from their own account instead of account of impugned companies. Moreover, applicant/accused, in spite of DDs given by complainant for depositing in Shriramcity Union Finance, without depositing the amount in the said company, for own gain, the said amount utilized by applicant/accused for the business of purchasing vehicles. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3 Learned counsel for applicant/accused submitted that applicant/accused has not committed any offence and he has been 2 falsely implicated in this offence. He further submitted that applicant/accused has no concerned with the investments of complainant in the names of Shriramcity Union Finance, Omisha Chit Funds, S. J. Trinity Finance Ltd etc. because at that time, he was employee of HDFC Bank Ltd. He further submitted that DDs drawn and issued in favour of impugned finance companies, and same were honoured in the account of said companies, therefore, question of wrongful gain and misappropriation of amount by applicant/accused not arise. He further submitted that applicant/accused resigned from his post of Branch Manager in the month of November 2011 and joined HDFC Bank, Sahakarnagar, Pune in the month of December 2011, therefore, applicant/accused has no concerned with the business of Shriramcity Union Finance since November 2011. He further submitted that the complainant was having business of money lending, therefore, applicant/accused demanded handloan to the complainant, therefore, complainant had given hand loan of Rs.30,00,000/­ through RTGS in December 2013 and the said hand loan was repaid by applicant/accused through RTGS in January 2014, in the account of wife of complainant, however, complainant deliberately harassed applicant/accused, for demanding large amount of interest on the said hand loan. Therefore, applicant/accused has paid Rs.2 lakh in cash, even though complainant repeatedly demanded Rs.8 lakh more as an interest but applicant/accused could not manage to pay the said amount, therefore, false case is filed against him. He further submitted that custodial interrogation of applicant/accused is not necessary, therefore, applicant­accused be released on anticipatory bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4. On the other hand, learned APP submitted that 3 applicant/accused utilized the amount of Rs.14,90,000/­, which was deposited by complainant in Shriramcity Union Finance for his own business of selling vehicles,and thereby committed wrongful gain and cheated to the complainant. He further submitted that applicant/accused by giving promise to give big returns, utilized amount of complainant and by showing that returns were made by the said company actually given amount from his own account. He further submitted that applicant/accused, Rs.10 lakh taken from complainant, for investing in Fixed deposit, but he deposited the same in the bank account of accused­Sidhesh More and investigation in respect of same is yet to be completed. He further submitted that applicant/accused by saying to complainant that he has deposited DDs in the concerned companies and returns received from companies, deposited in his account and account of his brother, and thereby misappropriated amount. He further submitted that as investigation is yet to be completed, therefore, custodial interrogation of the applicant/accused is necessary, therefore, his anticipatory bail application be rejected. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5. On perusing police papers, prima facie, it reveals that applicant/accused by giving promise to give better returns, induced complainant to deposit in Shriramcity Union Finance, Omisha Chit Funds, S. J. Trinity Finance Ltd and by obtaining DDs from the complainant actually not investing amount in the said companies, utilized amount for his own business of purchasing and selling vehicles. Moreover, prima facie it reveals that applicant/accused by his own accord from his personal account, transferred meager amount in the bank of complainant in order to showing returns of amount invested. Thus, prima facie, it reveals that the impugned returns are not transferred from finance companies, in which, 4 amount was invested by the complainant. Thus, prima facie, it shows that applicant/accused very clerverly utilized the amount invested by complainant, for his own gain. Therefore, in such circumstances, considering gravity of the offence, in my view, applicant/accused is not entitled to be released on anticipatory bail . Therefore, I pass the following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER i. Application is rejected. \r\n---order-ends---\r\nDate : 18/01/2019 (K.D.Vadane) Additional Sessions Judge, Pune. 5 “I affirm that the contents of the PDF file order are same word to word as per original judgment.” Name of Steno : Shri S.
