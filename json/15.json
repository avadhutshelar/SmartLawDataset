  "processedText": "Order below exh.1 in Cri. MA No. 16/2019 CNR No. MHPU01­000044—2019 \r\n---header-ends---\r\n1. Perused the application and say. Heard both the learned Counsel. 2. By this application, the applicants allegedly apprehending of being arrested by police on complaint of landlady – Jenis Das, to be registered at Koregaon Park Police Station, where earlier CR No. 101.2018 under Sections 354, 384, 441, 323, 504 r.w.s. 34 of IPC is registered on 15.09.2018. \r\n---background-ends---\r\nIt is objected over tenability and antecedents. Already the applicants are prosecuted in CR No. 101/2018. In investigation, the applicants were summoned, however they took it otherwise under the garb of apprehension. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3. On going through record, it is conspicuous that on 15.09.2018, Jenis Das, landlady in detail had lodged an FIR, against all the accused, as to how they in furtherance of their common intention abused and outraged her modesty in public, video­graphed the said act and terrorized her in public. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4. No separate crime is registered against the applicants. I am conscious that registration of crime is not sine­qua­non under Section 438 of Cr.P.C. However, circumstances around accusations levelled needs to be -2­ scanned properly to find out truth. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5. My sister colleagues, in Cri. M.A. No. 4422/2018 was pleased to grant pre­arrest bail on condition that the applicants shall make themselves available for interrogation by Police Officer as and when required. Deliberately, the applicants have suppressed this above fact, since only page 1 and 3 of said order is annexed to exh.3. However, for curiosity, when I have verified the said order from PDF file from dais, then the above fact was revealed. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6. The said practice is sheerly deprecable on the part of practicing lawyer. Learned AGP for the respondent have submitted that the applicants were summoned for interrogation purpose, liberty of which was kept in tact by the order, however, only to pressurize the police machinery, the applicants have present endeavour. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n7. In view of above, I see the applicant is devoid of merits. Hence, the order : \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER The application stands rejected. \r\n---order-ends---\r\nPune. (Vikas S.
