    "text": "ORDER BELOW EXH.01 IN CRI. BAIL APPLN. NO. 1/2019 This is an application for anticipatory bail as per section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Heard advocate Mr. V. B. Patil for applicants. He submitted that Crime No. 261/2018 is registered against these applicants with Borgaon Police Station for the offences punishable under sections 307 etc. read with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code. They are having strong apprehension of their arrest in this crime. But according to him, the FIR which is lodged by the wife of applicant No.2 against them is totally false and concocted. Alleged incident as mentioned in the FIR never took place. On that day, applicant No.1 was present in Satara Court while applicant No.2 had been to field. Merely to harass these applicants, false FIR came to be lodged.",

  "processedText": "1/7 Criminal Bail Application No. 1/2019 Smt. Shakila Gulab Mulani etc. 2 Vs. State of Maharashtra CNR­MHST010000001­2019 \r\n---header-ends---\r\nORDER BELOW EXH.01 IN CRI. BAIL APPLN. NO. 1/2019 This is an application for anticipatory bail as per section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Heard advocate Mr. V. B. Patil for applicants. He submitted that Crime No. 261/2018 is registered against these applicants with Borgaon Police Station for the offences punishable under sections 307 etc. read with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code. They are having strong apprehension of their arrest in this crime. But according to him, the FIR which is lodged by the wife of applicant No.2 against them is totally false and concocted. Alleged incident as mentioned in the FIR never took place. On that day, applicant No.1 was present in Satara Court while applicant No.2 had been to field. Merely to harass these applicants, false FIR came to be lodged. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2. He further argued that police by hook or crook are trying to take revenge against these applicants as they made complaint of ill­treatment against them before the Satara Court in other crime. Inquiry is in progress. By inviting my attention to the photographs produced on record along­with list at Exh.3, he submitted that the informant was happily staying with applicants. The so called chopper which is mentioned in the FIR was in her hands. Under such circumstances, there was no reason for applicant No.1 to try to beat her with that chopper. Allegations in the FIR are not attracting ingredients of section 307 of the Indian Penal Code. By way of incidents which are mentioned by the informant in the FIR, it cannot be said that both the applicants attempted to commit her murder. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3. He invited my attention to the various documents produced on record regarding other crime which is registered against these applicants so also the medical certificate of applicant No.1. According to him, she is the patient of low calcium. Their custodial interrogation is not at all warranted. They are local residents and are ready to obey with all the conditions those may be imposed upon them. Therefore he prayed that by imposing certain conditions, applicants may be released on anticipatory bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4. APP Mr. Muke by filing his say at Exh.8 strongly resisted the application. He replied that at the relevant time, both the applicants attempted to commit murder of wife of applicant No.2 by strangulating her throat, by pelting the steel water pot on her head and by means of chopper. From the date of registration of crime, both the applicants are absconding. They are having antecedents as so many crimes including of similar type are registered against them.  \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5. He also pointed out to me that Hon\u0027ble Bombay High Court restrained both the applicants from entering the village Titavewadi till 31/12/2018. But still both the applicants by flouting that order, entered village Titavewadi and have committed such serious offence. There is no reason for the wife of applicant No.2 to implicate both the applicants falsely. During the course of investigation, role of both these applicants is transpired. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6. He invited my attention to the medico­legal certificate of the informant/prosecutrix so also the statements which came to be recorded during the course of investigation. He submitted that to seize the weapons used in the commission of offence, custodial interrogation of these applicants is very much necessary. Taking into consideration the nature and seriousness of offence and conduct of both the applicants, they do not deserve to get pre­ arrest protection. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n7. According to him, this offence has nothing to do with so called complaint of ill­treatment made by these applicants against the police. Because the FIR has been lodged by the daughter­in­law of applicant No.1 and wife of applicant No.2. On all these grounds, he submitted that application may be rejected. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n8. In reply, advocate Mr. Patil submitted that there may be list of offences against these applicants. But not in a single case, they are convicted by the Court. Alleged offences are of sale of illicit liquor and those are not so serious. These applicants did not enter the village Titavewadi, but a false story is cooked by the prosecution with the help of informant/prosecutrix to book these applicants. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n9. After going through the FIR lodged by informant/ prosecutrix, it is seen that initially on 27/12/2018 both the applicants abused and beat her. Applicant No.2 beat her with wooden log on her left leg, thigh and back. On 29/12/2018 at about 12.30 p.m., by suspecting her morality, applicant No.1 beat her with fist and kick blows and hurled the steel water pot on her head. In the meanwhile, applicant No.2 also reached there. He abused, threatened and beat her with fist and kick blows. By saying applicant No.1 that they should not spare the informant/ prosecutrix and they should kill her, applicant No.1 instigated applicant No.2 and thereby applicant No.1 strangulated her throat. Applicant No.1 asked him to strangulate her throat till she brings the chopper from the house and thereafter she went inside the house to bring chopper in order to kill her. But the informant was frightened and anyhow she rescued herself from the clutches of both the applicants and ran away. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n10. Then informant took one mobile phone from the persons passing thereby and informed her parents. Her parents  came there. She was taken to Primary Health Center, Nagthane for treatment and then she lodged the FIR with Borgaon Police Station in the presence of her parents. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n11. Alleged offence is too serious. Considering the medico­ legal certificate of the informant/prosecutrix, it is seen that she has sustained as many as 7 injuries on her person. The weapons used in the commission of offence i.e. wooden log and chopper so also the water pot are yet to be seized. For that purpose, physical presence of these applicants is necessary with the police. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n12. Apart from that, by flouting the order passed by Hon\u0027ble Bombay High Court in earlier Bail Application, both the applicants were found entered in the village Titavewadi and have committed such offence. APP Mr. Muke during the course of arguments submitted that police have obtained certificate from the Village Police Patil to show that at the relevant time, both the applicants were in the village. Investigation to that effect is also required to be done. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n13. In the investigation papers, list of crimes registered against both these applicants is annexed by the police. It is seen that earlier also, an offence punishable under section 307 read with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code is registered against these applicants apart from one more bodily offence and offences under  the Maharashtra Prohibition Act. There are also allegations in the FIR that applicant No.1 was compelling the small sons of informant to sell illicit liquor and she was not liking it. Being enraged, applicant No.1 used to abuse and beat her. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n14. Regarding the so called complaint of ill­treatment made by these applicants against police officials of Borgaon Police Station, in my opinion that offence or incident has not at all any bearing on this crime. Considering the nature and seriousness of accusation and gravity of the offences, investigation is to be carried out in its proper perspective. Weapons used in the commission of offence are yet to be seized and for that purpose, custodial interrogation of these applicants is certainly required. If pre­arrest protection is granted to these applicants then entire investigation would be paralyzed. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n15. Advocate Mr. Patil for applicants relied on the case of Rani alias Rekha W/o. Babasaheb More and others Vs. The State of Maharashtra in Anticipatory Bail Application No.1213 of 2018, in which it is held by Hon\u0027ble Bombay High Court that, “when the acts which were attributed to applicants in the FIR were in respect of limited role of beating by means of fist and kick blows and injury report revealed that no physical injury was found then considering the overall facts of that case, Hon\u0027ble Bombay High Court granted pre­arrest protection to applicants therein also considering the fact that no recovery was to be made from them.” \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n16. However such is not the position in the case at hands. In the case at hands, the weapons used in the commission of offence i.e. wooden log, chopper so also the steel water pot are to be seized from these applicants. They were found entered in the village by flouting the orders of Hon\u0027ble Bombay High Court. Antecedents on record, show their involvement in similar type of offences earlier also. Therefore with due respect the law laid down by Hon\u0027ble Bombay High Court in this cited case is not coming to the help of these applicants. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n17. Considering the overall facts and circumstances, nature and seriousness of accusation, gravity of offences as well as the role played by them coupled with their conduct and behaviour, they do not deserve to get pre­arrest protection. Hence the order follows :­ \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER Application is rejected. \r\n---order-ends---\r\n(Order is dictated and pronounced in the open Court) Satara (R.D.Deshpande) Dt.24/01/2019. Additional Sessions Judge, Satara."
