It appears that custodial interrogation of the applicant/accused is now not necessary. Therefore, in my view by imposing some conditions i.e. attending the Police Station and to cooperate the Investigating Officer in the investigation, if the present applicant ­accused is released on anticipatory bail, no prejudice will be caused to the prosecution. Hence, application deserves to be allowed. Therefore, I pass the following order.",

  "processedText": "CNR No.MHPUO1­000528­2019 Taranjitsing Daulatram Chhabada Vs. The State of Maharashtra (Market Yard Police Station) Order below Exh. 1 in Cri. Bail Application No.128/2019 \r\n---header-ends---\r\n1. The applicant­ accused has filed present application for anticipatory bail u/s.438 of Cr.P.C. in connection with C.R. No.248/2017 registered with Market Yard Police Station for the offences punishable u/s. 385, 386, 387, 504, 506(2) r/w.s 34 of the Indian Penal Code. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2. Prosecution case is that on 16/08/2017, accused No.1­ Ajitsing threatened to the complainant ­Harmit B. Gurudatt and demanded Rs.1,58,000/­. Accordingly, complainant transferred the said amount. Thereafter, on 19/07/2017 and 20/09/2017, applicant/accused made demand of Rs.50,000/­ and threatened to pour acid on Jasprit Kaur, and thereafter on 22/11/2017, accused No.1 ­Ajitsingh made demand of Rs.10,000/­ by sending SMS. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3. Learned counsel for applicant/accused submitted that applicant/accused has not committed any offence, and he has been falsely implicated in this offence. He further submitted that after death of husband of complainant\u0027s sister, there was domestic dispute took place, and the said matter was settled. He further submitted that applicant No.1\u0027s mother paid cash amount of Rs. 10 lakh to the complainant\u0027s sister. He further submitted that alleged offence is triable by learned JMFC court. He further submitted that there is no criminal antecedent against applicant/accused. Custodial interrogation of the applicant/accused is not necessary, therefore, his anticipatory bail be granted.\r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4. On the other hand, learned APP submitted that statement of Jasprit Kaur is yet to be recorded. If applicant/accused is released on anticipatory bail, there is possibility of pressurizing the prosecution witnesses. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5. On perusing police papers, prima facie, it reveals that on the basis of report lodged by Harmit Gurudatt, a crime No.248/2017 came to be recorded at Market Yard Police Station. Moreover, it seems that there was some domestic dispute took place between Complainant\u0027s sister and accused persons and same was settled. It appears that custodial interrogation of the applicant/accused is now not necessary. Therefore, in my view by imposing some conditions i.e. attending the Police Station and to cooperate the Investigating Officer in the investigation, if the present applicant ­accused is released on anticipatory bail, no prejudice will be caused to the prosecution. Hence, application deserves to be allowed. Therefore, I pass the following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER i. Application is allowed. ii. In the event of arrest of applicants­ accused ­Taranjitsing Daulatram Chhabada, he be released on anticipatory bail on furnishing P.R. Bond in a sum of Rs.25,000/­ (Rs. Twenty five thousand only), with one or two solvent sureties in the like amount. iii. The applicant­ accused shall attend concerned Police Station as and when required by the Investigating Officer and shall co­operate with the Investigation Agency till filing of charge sheet. iv. The applicant­ accused shall not tamper with prosecution evidence. 3 v. The applicant ­accused shall not leave India without permission of the Court. \r\n---order-ends---\r\nDate : 23/01/2019 (K.D.Vadane) Additional Sessions Judge, Pune. 4 “I affirm that the contents of the PDF file order are same word to word as per original judgment.” Name of Steno : Shri S.
