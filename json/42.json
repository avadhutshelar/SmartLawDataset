From the FIR, it is clear that there was some loan transaction between accused / applicant and the informant and they had purchased one pick up vehicle which was ultimately seized by the finance company for non payment of installments and on 20­12­ 2018, applicant and her husband alleged to have visited the house of the informant demanding amount of loan and applicant / accused had threatened the informant that she would commit suicide. It is alleged that applicant had forcefully taken the motorcycle of another son of informant. Having regard to the allegations made against the accused / applicant, prima­facie there is no material to suggest that accused / applicant had any intention to drive deceased Pawan to commit suicide. In suicide note, it is only mentioned that because of applicant, deceased committed suicide, but no further details are given. Having regard to the allegations made against the accused / applicant in the FIR and the transaction between the informant and the accused / applicant, I find that no further purpose will be served by keeping accused / applicant in jail.

Respondent. \r\n---header-ends---\r\nORDER BELOW EXH.1 This is the first bail application by accused Gayabai Mandubaba Palave @ Gayabai Dagadu Andhale under Section 439 of Criminal Procedure Code for regular bail, in connection with C.R.No.497/2018, registered by MIDC Bhosari police station, for the offence punishable under section 306, 506, r/w 34 of the Indian Penal Code. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n[2] Perused the application and say given by the respondent at Exh.3. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[3] Heard learned advocate Mr. D\u0027Lima for the applicant / accused and APP Mr. Aurangabadkar for the respondent.\r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[4] By taking me through the FIR, advocate Mr. D\u0027Lima argued that accused / applicant is falsely implicated in the present crime. There is nothing on record to show that accused / applicant had abetted deceased Pawan for committing suicide. The loan was taken by the father of the deceased and accused was demanding back the loan money from the father of the deceased. The vehicle which alleged to have been taken forcefully by the accused / applicant was owned by the brother of the deceased. Therefore, deceased had no connection with the said incident. The alleged overtact of the accused / applicant are only suggesting that she was interested in getting her money back. He further submitted that the accused / applicant is law abiding citizen, a female and has no criminal antecedents and is ready to abide any condition. He prayed for the bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[5] The learned APP for respondent argued that the offence in question is serious in nature. The investigation is in progress. There is suicide note in which blame is given to the accused / applicant. If the accused / applicant is released on bail, the chances of tampering with the prosecution evidence cannot be ruled out. He prayed for rejection of the bail application. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[6] I have gone through the FIR produced for perusal by applicant as well as by the learned APP and also the alleged suicide note. From the FIR, it is clear that there was some loan transaction between accused / applicant and the informant and they had purchased one pick up vehicle which was ultimately seized by the finance company for non payment of installments and on 20­12­ 2018, applicant and her husband alleged to have visited the house of the informant demanding amount of loan and applicant / accused had threatened the informant that she would commit suicide. It is alleged that applicant had forcefully taken the motorcycle of another son of informant. Having regard to the allegations made against the accused / applicant, prima­facie there is no material to suggest that accused / applicant had any intention to drive deceased Pawan to commit suicide. In suicide note, it is only mentioned that because of applicant, deceased committed suicide, but no further details are given. Having regard to the allegations made against the accused / applicant in the FIR and the transaction between the informant and the accused / applicant, I find that no further purpose will be served by keeping accused / applicant in jail. Hence, the following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER [1] The application is allowed. [2] The applicant Gayabai Mandubaba Palave @ Gayabai Dagadu Andhale is released on bail, on her executing PR Bond of Rs.30,000/­, with one or two sureties of like amount, in connection with C.R.No. 497/2018, registered by MIDC Bhosari police station, Pune, on following conditions :­ [A] The applicant / accused shall not tamper with the prosecution evidence in any manner. [B] The applicant / accused shall co­operate in the investigation. [C] The applicant / accused shall attend MIDC Bhosari police station on every Monday from 10 a.m. to 12 noon, for next two months. [3] Bail before concerned JMFC. \r\n---order-ends---\r\nPune, Dated/­09­01­2019 ( Aniruddha Y. Thatte ) Additional Sessions Judge, Pune. Cri.B.A.No.50/2019 4 CNR No.CNR NO.
