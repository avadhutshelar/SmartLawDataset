  "processedText": "Criminal Bail Application No.157/2019 CNR NO. MHPU01­000585­2019 Priyanka Sanjay Sonwane …. Applicant. Vs. State of Maharashtra …. Respondent. \r\n---header-ends---\r\nORDER BELOW EXH.1 This is the first bail application filed by the applicant under Section 438 of the Criminal Procedure Code for anticipatory bail in C.R.No.17/2019 registered by Nigadi Police Station under Section 304, 323, 341, 504 r/w 34 of the Indian Penal Code. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n[2] Perused the application and say given by respondent at Exh.5. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[3] I have heard Shri. Patil for the applicant and APP Shri. Aurangabadkar for the State. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[4] The learned advocate for the accused / applicant argued that the applicant is falsely implicated in the present crime just because she is daughter­in­law staying separate from the family because of the disputes between the husband and wife. He argued that it is alleged that applicant\u0027s relatives had been to the house of accused and the alleged incident took place. The FIR is silent about the presence of the accused / applicant at the time of incident. The applicant is falsely implicated in the crime. She has no criminal antecedents. The custodial interrogation of the applicant is not necessary and she is ready to abide any condition if imposed. She prayed for bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[5] Here I may note that another Criminal Bail Application No. 156/2019 arising out of the same crime is also pending for hearing with this case and in that case learned advocate Shri. Sinalkar appeared through the informant opposing the anticipatory bail application of other co­accused. Though Shri. Sinalkar has not put his appearance in the present case, at Bar he fairly conceded that so far as applicant / accused Priyanka is concerned, she is not connected with the crime. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[6] The learned APP Mr. Aurangabadkar for State fairly submitted that after going through the FIR, it appears that the applicant / accused Priyanka was not present at the time of incident. But, he submitted that the possibility that accused shared common intention with other co­accused cannot be ruled out. He prayed for rejection of the application. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[7] I have gone through the FIR. It is clear from the FIR that at the time of incident, applicant Priyanka was not present at the spot of incident. Only her name is appearing in the concluding part of the FIR. So, having regard to the allegations in the FIR and the arguments for the parties, I pass the following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER [1] The application is allowed. [2] The interim anticipatory bail granted to the applicant Priyanka Sanjay Sonwane @ Priyanka Dharmraj Desai by order passed below Exh.4 dated 09­01­2019 is hereby made absolute, with the same terms and conditions. [3] Inform concerned police station accordingly. \r\n---order-ends---\r\nPune, Dated/­21­01­2019 ( Aniruddha Y. Thatte ) Additional Sessions Judge, Pune. Cri.B.A.No. 157/19 4 CNR No.MHPU01­000585­2019 I affirm that the contents of the PDF file Judgment are same word for word as per original Judgment. Name of Steno :­ Shri. V. V.
