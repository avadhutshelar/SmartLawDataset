NO. 20/2019 \r\n---header-ends---\r\nThis is an application for regular bail as per section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 for applicant. Heard Advocate Mr.Dhaigude for applicant. He submitted that, Crime No.225/2018 is registered against applicant with Khandala Police Station for the offences punishable under sections 498­A, 306, 323 read with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code. Applicant is behind the bars since 21/12/2018. Investigation is practically completed. Further presence of this applicant is no more required by the Police. He is old aged. The deceased, who was his daughter­in­ law has left behind her two small children. His wife is also suffering from various ailments. There is nobody to take their care. Applicant is local resident and he is ready to obey with all the conditions those may be imposed upon him. Therefore, he prayed that applicant may be released on bail. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2. APP Mrs. Diwakar by filing her say at Exh.4 resisted the application. She submitted that allegations levelled against applicant in the F.I.R. are serious. He along with other accused in furtherance of their common intention subjected the deceased to cruelty on flimsy grounds. Having fed up with their ill­treatment, deceased committed suicide by hanging in her house. Investigation is in progress. If applicant is released on bail then he is likely to tamper with the evidence of prosecution. Therefore, she submitted that application may be rejected. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3. Applicant is behind the bars since 21/12/2018. Therefore, by this time investigation might have been practically completed. The wife of applicant is already released on bail by this Court. Applicant is old aged as mentioned in the application. There is nobody to take care of the small children of the deceased as their father i.e. main accused is also behind the bars. Applicant is old aged and happens to be the local resident. He is shepherd. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4. Considering these aspects, he deserves to be released on bail upon certain conditions. No prejudice will be caused to the prosecution if he is released on bail on certain conditions. Hence the following order :­ \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER 1 Application is allowed. 2 In Crime No. 225/2018 registered with Khandala Police Station for the offences punishable under sections 498­A, 306 read with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, applicant Maruti Dhondiba Khadake be released on bail upon his executing P.R.
