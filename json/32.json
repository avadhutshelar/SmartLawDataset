Heard both the learned Counsel. 2. By this application, under Section 439 of Cr.P.C., the applicant / accused –Ravi Kumar Sharma, seeks regular bail in Crime No. 143/2018, registered on 06.02.2018 with Hadpsar Police Station, Pune, under Sections 420, 467, 468, 471 of Indian Penal Code. It is objected over nature of offence, criminal antecedents and ongoing investigation. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n3. The learned Counsel for the applicant has submitted that the applicant is not concerned with the offence. The present offence is emanated from commercial transaction between informant and the accused. The former supplied grapes while latter exported the same, being an Agent. The quality of the grapes was refused by the concerned Country. Therefore, amount thereof remained unpaid. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4. The learned AGP has submitted that the applicant was paid by the concerned customer and the consideration was deposited in his account, but it was not 2 transferred to the account of victim. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5. On going through record, it is conspicuous that the applicant acted as an commission agent, exported grapes of farmers to Russia. He has committed alike offences wherein innocent farmers were duped. Also, cheques issued by him against the consideration of grapes were dishonoured. Alike offences at Niphad, Nasik, Pimpalgaon Baswant, are registered. Things did not rest there. The applicant committed alike offences even out of Maharashtra. CR No. 0708/2017 at Civil Line Police Thana, Harayana under Section 420, 406, 506, 467, 468. 471 of IPC is registered. The learned Counsel for the applicant has submitted that Harayana High Court was pleased to grant him bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6. In the case­in­hand, record shows that the applicant has exported grapes of victim and amassed the consideration, since it was deposited in his account. However, on 19.09.2017 he endeavoured to inform the victim that five containers were rejected over quality. That speaks everything about his modus operandi. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n7. The learned Counsel for the informant in his written objection exh. 6 has minutely demonstrated the 3 container numbers, date and details of sale­notes, total worth 74,890 US $, i.e. Rs. 52,42,300/­. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n8. Considering magnitude of offence, involvement of applicant in the crime, possibility of fleeing away from Nation, in my view, it would not be apposite to enlarge the applicant even on conditional bail. Hence, the order : \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER Application stands rejected. \r\n---order-ends---\r\nPune ( Vikas S.
