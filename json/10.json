Therefore, her husband Madhukar Thorat and his 2­3 associates made attack on the house of Complainant. They had taken search of his son Akshay and thereafter they had made assault by means of sickle and iron rod with an intention to kill and caused serious injuries to him and while taking treatment in Sassoon Hospital, Pune he succumbed to the injuries. On the basis of that complaint, this offence was came to be registered. Applicants are arrested on 03/12/2018. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3] Advocate for the applicants in his argument stated that deceased Akshay was habitual offender and drunkard. There was 2 no motive or intention of applicants to commit his murder. The incident was happened in spur of moment. Investigation has been completed . Further detention of the applicants is not necessary. There are no criminal antecedents against them. All these three accused are housewives. Therefore, they may be released on bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4] Ld. DGP strongly opposed this application. It is her contention that offence is serious. It is punishable upto life imprisonment. Investigation is not yet completed. At this juncture if these applicants would be released on bail, there is possibility of tampering the prosecution witnesses who are residents of same locality and evidence. Hence, this application may be rejected. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5] IO filed say to this application. In his say he has stated that the applicants and witnesses are residents of same locality. If this application will be allowed, there is possibility of tampering prosecution witnesses. So also possibility cannot be ruled out that applicants will call their relatives and again would pick up quarrel. CA report is awaited with muddemal property sent for analysis. Therefore, this application may be rejected. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6] Major part of the investigation is already completed. All these three applicants are ladies. Nothing remained to be recovered or discovered from them. Only CA report is awaited. By imposing stringent conditions on them, they can be released on bail. Hence, I pass the following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER 1. Bail Application Nos.11/2019 and 40/2019 are allowed conditionally. 2.
