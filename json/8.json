  "processedText": "Bail application no.9/2019 Order below Exh.01 in Bail Application No.9/2019 (CNR­MHPU01­000005­2019) \r\n---header-ends---\r\n1] Applicant­Johara @ Shama Mustaq Shaikh has filed this application for bail under section 439 of Cr.P.C. in connection with CR No.821/2018 of Kondhwa Police Station under sections 8 (c), 20 (b) (ii) (B), 27 (A), 29 of N.D.P.S. Act. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2] It is the case of prosecution that, 22/09/2018 accused nos.1 and 2 have been arrested by the police of Anti­Narcotic Cell in Kondhwa Police Station in CR no.821/2018 for possessing 2 Kg. 174 Gram Ganja along with mobile hand set of Samsung Make and cash amount. Hence, on the complaint of Pravin Shirke, API of Anti­Narcotic Cell, Pune, this offence was registered. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3] Advocate for the applicant in his argument stated that if the total quantity of seized Ganja is divided into two accused, the quantity of Ganja allegedly possessed by each accused is more than small quantity but less than commercial quantity. Therefore, bar under section 37 of NDPS Act is not attracted. In this context, reliance is placeed on unreported judgment of Bombay High Court in Cri. Appln. no.1865/2017 dated 26/04/2017 in case of Shubham Gopala Shahu Vs. State of Maharashtra. Investigation almost completed, only CA report is awaited. Therefore, further detention of the applicant is not necessary. Hence, she may be relesaed on bail. 2 \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4] Ld. APP strongly opposed this application. It is his contention that investigation is not yet completed. Offence is serious. It is committed against soceity. That stock of Ganja was found possesed with an intention to sell it. If this applicant will be released on bail, she will flee away from justice and there is possibility of tampering the prosecution witnesses and evidence. Hence, this application may be rejected. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5] In above stated unreported judgment of Hon\u0027ble High Court Bench at Aurangabad, the quantity of Ganja involved in that case was 10.572 kg. Therefore, Hon\u0027ble High Court observed that it is less than commercial quantity, therefore, there is no bar under section 37 of NDPS Act. Hence, Hon\u0027ble High Court released the applicant on bail. The ratio laid down in that case is squarely applicable to the present case as the quantity involved is less than commercial quantity, therefore there is no bar under section 37 of NDPS Act. Custodial interrogation of the applicant is already over. Further detention of the applicant is not necessary. Hence, I pass the following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER 1. Bail Application No.9/2019 is allowed. 2. Applicant­ Johara @ Shama Mustaq Shaikh be released on bail in CR No.821/2018 of Kondhwa Police Station under sections 8 (c), 20 (b) (ii) (B), 27 (A), 29 of N.D.P.S.
