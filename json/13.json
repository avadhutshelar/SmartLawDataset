When she returned to house, she was in frightened condition. Upon inquiry with her, she told that on previous day when she was playing near public toilet, applicant was in toilet in nude condition, he called her near him and showed his private part.

He is permanently residing at Aundh, Dist­Pune. He has no criminal antecedents. He is ready to abide the conditions. Hence, he prayed to release him on bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4] APP and I.O. objected this application on the ground that investigation is in progress. Applicant will pressurize victim and 2 Cri.Bail Application no. 14/19 witnesses. There is possibility of tampering prosecution evidence. Previously in Sangvi Police Station, offence p/u/s 376,323 \u0026 506 of IPC is filed against applicant. So, they prayed to reject the application. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5] Allegations against the applicant are serious. Applicant is interrogated. Statements of most of the witnesses are recorded.

Ratio laid down in above citation is noted. Applicant is resident of Aundh Pune. Moreover, investigation is almost over. Therefore, only on the ground of criminal antecedents, it is not proper to deny the bail. If strict conditions are imposed it will suffice the purpose Therefore, application deserves to be allowed with following order: \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER 1] The application is allowed. 2] The applicant Umesh @ Pappu Ravindra Sarkaniya be released on executing P.R. bond of Rs.50,000/­ with one or two solvent sureties 3 Cri.Bail Application no. 14/19 in the like amount.
