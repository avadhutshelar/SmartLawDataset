State of Maharashtra) CNR : MHST01­000276­2019 \r\n---header-ends---\r\n1) Present application is filed by the applicants under section 438 of Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 apprehending their arrest under C.R. no. 15/2019, registered at Lonand police station, at the instance of Yogesh Bhanudas Dhaygude, for alleged commission of offences punishable under sections 143, 147, 148, 323, 324, 326, 327, 504 and 506 r/w. 149 of Indian Penal Code, 1860. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2) FIR is claimed to be false, fabricated and aggravated contending that, the incidence alleged is dated 20/01/2019 and FIR is lodged on 22/01/2019, inspite of he fact that informant himself states that after the incident, he went to his house, then went to the police station and then to a private hospital. False injury certificate is sought by the informant from a private hospital. FIR delayed by two days is not explained. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3) It is contended that, FIR can be seen to be false from the fact that time of occurrence is stated to be of 09:00 p.m. in the sugar­cane fields ready for harvesting, in such circumstances, informant claims to have seen, in the dark of the night, with precision the articles carried by each of applicant in their hands. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4) FIR is also contended to be false from the fact that allegations are of ten accused having assaulted the informant with sticks, axe and other article, however, no alarm is raised by the informant. Allegations are that informant\u0027s brother came at the spot and was assaulted and he became unconscious, but nobody is stated to have seen the incidence except the informant and his brother. Both have suffered two injuries each and only one being grievous.\r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5) It is contended that, allegations in the FIR are also of the informant\u0027s chain being snatched, however charges of it are not levelled, thus those allegations being false. Allegations are that at the relevant time, applicants were excavating sands from the stream­let, however FIR does not contain charges on that counts, under any of the relevant Act/s. Therefore, informant stating that applicants were extracting sands is also false. It is contended that, if at all, the informant\u0027s case is to be believed that incident occurred out of mis­conception then, there would be no circumstances for about ten men assaulting the informant or his brother. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6) It is contended that, informant himself is a habitual and heavy drunkard and the possibilities of sustaining injuries by fall under intoxication cannot be ruled out. It is also contended that, applicants are minority in the village and the Dhaygudes\u0027 outnumber the applicant\u0027s caste persons and do not want the applicant\u0027s caste members to participate in village politics and welfare activities. Hence, have filed false FIR against all members of the applicant\u0027s family. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n7) It is contended that, FIR is false and frivolously filed against applicant\u0027s entire family members and even against the persons not in the village, the said night. Placing reliance on a certificate issued by the Krushiganga Sparda Pariksha Margdarshan Kendra, Satara and also on affidavits submitted by Vishal Ramesh Gawade, Shekhar Suresh Yadav and Ganesh Satish Bhoite, applicant\u0027s advocate contended that, Akshay Ankush Jamdade was not in the village at all, that night and was in a coaching center in Satara city, preparing for his MPSC exams, since morning 07:00 am to 12:00 midnight. In no circumstances could Akshay be in the village and he is falsely roped in the FIR merely to scuttle his bright prospects. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n8) Placing reliance on Ambadas Kisan Bhagwat and Ors. Vs. State of Maharasthra 2015 All MR(Cri) 721 and Pankaj Vidyasagar Gupta Vs. State of Maharasthra 1989 Mh.L.J. 30, it is also contended that in no circumstances, is applicants\u0027 presence required for investigation or seizure in the matter. Accordingly, pre­arrest bail is contended. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n9) Bail application is resisted by the APP by filing say at Exh. 7 on the grounds that, about ten men armed with sticks, iron rod, and axe assaulted the informant and his brother. Injuries are grievous in nature. Both have sustained injuries on their head. Informant\u0027s left hand is fractured. Both are yet seeking treatment. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n10) APP contended that, accused Ankush Anandrao Jamdade had played vital role in assaulting the informant and his brother. APP further contended that, investigation in the matter is yet continuing, accused\u0027s custodial presence is required for seizing the articles. Both the parties are from same village, in case of grant of pre­arrest bail, pressurizing the witness, the informant, his brother, tampering the evidence and repetition of similar incidence cannot be ruled out. APP contended that, the cited rulings do not assist the applicants. Accordingly, bail is resisted. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n11) Upon hearing the advocate for the either sides and perusing the documents placed on record, it appears that, incidence occurred while applicants were de­silting the stream­let in the night hours at about 09:00 pm. Incidence allegedly has occurred out of the applicant\u0027s mis­conception of the informant making complaint to the Tahsildar or to the police about the applicant\u0027s illegally excavating the stream­let. Allegations are that informant and his brother is assaulted by about ten persons armed with sticks, iron rod, knife and axe. Injury certificate reveals one grievous injury sustained by informant. At the same time, it also appears that, informant as well as his brother have taken discharge from the hospital the next day after getting admitted. Both he injured were in state to give their statement, however statement is recorded after a delay of about more than a day. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n12) Documents placed on record also prima­facie reveal that one of the accused viz. Akshay Ankush Jamdade was not in the village at the time of occurrence and was in Satara city. The number of persons alleged to have assaulted and the arms allegedly carried by them apparently do not coincide with the injuries sustained. Offence is also not registered for illegal di­ silting or also of chain snatching. Indeed, there appears no justification put forth by the Investigation Officer for not recording the injureds\u0027 statement for more than a day after giving the medical treatment note. Alleged incident is dated 20/01/2019. FIR is dated 22/01/2019. Present pre­arrest bail application is preferred on 25/01/2019. Accused being from the same village, however not being arrested even after 3 days of the registering of FIR, it appears that, Investigating Officer is not much interested in seeking the accused\u0027s custody for investigation. Considering the observations in Ambadas (Supra), it appears that, denying bail would be improper, only for the purpose of facilitating seizure. However, applicants presence and co­operation shall have to be secured for completing the investigation. Hence, the following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER 1) Criminal Bail Application no. 49/2019, is allowed. 2) In the event of arrest of applicant no. 1 Pratap Anandrao Jamdade, no. 2 Ramdas Anandrao Jamdade, no. 3 Mohan Anandrao Jamdade, no. 4 Ankush Anandrao Jamdade, no.5 Shubham Mohan Jamdade, no. 6 Atul Ankush Jamdade, no. 7 Akshay Ankush Jamdade, no. 8 Yuvraj Pratap Jamdade, no. 9 Kiran Pratap Jamdade and no. 10 Suraj Ramdas Jamdade, they be released on bail under C.R. no. 15/2019, registered at Lonand police station, on their furnishing personal bond of Rs. 25,000/­ each (Rs. Twenty Five Thousand each) with atleast one or more surety/ies, to make up the bond amount, on the following terms and conditions :­ a) Applicants shall attend the concerned police station twice in a week preferably on every Monday and Friday in between 11:00 a.m. to 2.00 p.m. b) Applicants shall not tamper with any evidence. c) Applicants shall not directly or indirectly make any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the case so as to dissuade him from disclosing such facts to the court or to any Police Officer. d) Applicants shall make available themselves and co­ operate for interrogation by Police Officer as and when required. e) Applicants shall produce, such documents as called for by the investigating officer. f) Any default of above conditions, shall render the bail to be cancelled automatically. \r\n---order-ends---\r\n(Y.
