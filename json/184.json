By this application under Section 439 of Cr.P.C., applicant/ accused­ Parmeshwar Gangadhar Boyale of CR No. 309/2018 registered on 27.09.2018 with Vimantal Police Station, Pune, under Sections 302, 323, 201 of Indian Penal Code, seeks regular bail. It is objected over nature of offence and inaction on the part of the applicant, in applying for bail under Section 167(2) of Cr.P.C., before filing charge­sheet. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n3. The learned Counsel for the applicant has submitted that the prosecution did not file charge­sheet within 90 days, i.e. statutory period. It was duty of the concern Magistrate to inform the applicant, calling him upon to exercise his right under Section 167(2) of Cr.P.C. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4. The learned AGP has submitted that no sooner charge­sheet is filed, subsequent application of accused under this Section could not be entertained. Thus, the Magistrate has rightly rejected the application. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5. On going through record, it is conspicuous that the applicant was produced before concerned Magistrate on 27.09.2018. Thus, from that date, within 90 days, the prosecution was supposed to file charge­sheet but it came to be filed on 27.12.2018, on 91st day. The applicant applied for bail on 04.01.2019. Only on that count, his application came to be rejected. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6. It is conspicuous from the record that since 6 months, the applicant had visiting terms with informant and was allegedly altercating the victim. On 26.09.2018 at 7.30 a.m., victim Uma had been to the place of work and did not return. There was search at the hands of informant and he came to know that her body was lying. There were ligature marks around her neck. The informant suspected the applicant to be accused, since the victim refused to marry him. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n7. Report of postmortem reveals that there were multiple abrasions and contusions on body. Pannel of Medical Officers, effecting autopsy has opined that cause of death is due to ligature strangulation. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n8. Further it reveals from record that motor­bike and cell­phone allegedly used in commission of offence has been discovered at the instance of the applicant. Present case is based upon circumstantial evidence, more particularly upon last seen theory. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n9. Even otherwise, as has observed earlier, the applicant would have been released under Section 167(2) of Cr.P.C., had he applied on 91st day, from the date of his production before Magistrate, notwithstanding it was obligatory on the part of Magistrate to inform him about non filing of charge­sheet with statutory period. Thus, on both counts, he deserves conditional bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n10. In view of above, I pass following order : \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER 1. Application stands allowed as under:­ Applicant be released on furnishing P.R.Bond of Rs. 25,000/­ with one or two sureties or cash security of like amount on following conditions. a] He shall not tamper prosecution witnesses. b] He shall not leave India sans the permission of this Court. 2.
