Bail application No.223/2019 1. This is an application U/s.439 of Cr.P.C. filed by the applicant­accused for grant of bail in connection with Crime No. 14/2019 , registered with Market Yard Police Station for the offence punishable u/s.188, 272, 273, 328 of the IPC and 59 of Food and Drug Safety Standard Act. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2. Prosecution case is that on 08/01/2019, as per information received to Market Yard Police Station, P. I. Shri. Satav carried raid on Panshop of applicant/accused, at that time, it is disclosed that the applicant/accused was having in possession contraband articles ­Gutka etc., therefore, offence was registered, therefore, offence registered against him.\r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3. Learned counsel for applicant/accused submitted that applicant/accused has not committed any offence, he has been falsely implicated in this offence. He further submitted that custodial interrogation of the applicant/accused is not necessary, therefore, he be released on bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4. On the other hand, learned APP submitted that if applicant/accused is released on bail, there is possibility of tampering the prosecution evidence. He further submitted that investigation is yet to be completed, therefore, application be rejected. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5. On perusing police papers, prima facie, it reveals that on 08/01/2019, Market Yard Police have carried raid on Panshop of applicant/accused, at that time, applicant/accused was found in possession of Gutka and other contraband articles i.e. tobacco. It 2 appears that as the contraband articles are seized, therefore, custodial interrogation of applicant/accused is not necessary. Therefore, considering all these aspects, in my view if present applicant­ accused is released on bail on certain conditions, no prejudice will be caused to the prosecution. Hence, I pass the following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER i. Application is allowed. ii. The applicant ­accused­ Hemant Kantilal Dodiya be released on bail on furnishing P.R. Bond of Rs.25,000/­ (Rupees Twenty five Thousand Only) with one or two solvent sureties in like amount. iii. The applicant­ accused shall not tamper with prosecution evidence. iv.
