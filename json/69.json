Bail Application No. 81/2019 1. The applicants­accused have filed present application for anticipatory bail u/s.438 of Cr.P.C. in connection with C.R. No.192/2018 registered with Khadak Police Station for the offences punishable u/s.406, 420 r/w.s34 of the Indian Penal Code. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2. Prosecution case is that accused Nos. 1 to 4 in respect of having knowledge about 60 gunthas land out of land Gat No.32 of Alegaon Paga, Tal. Shirur, District­Pune, reserved by Government agreed to sale land for consideration of Rs.20 lakh to the complainant, and accepted amount of Rs.3,50,000/­ as an earnest amount and utilized the said amount for their own purpose and thereby misappropriated amount and cheated to the complainant. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3. Learned advocate for applicants/accused that applicant/accused are innocent persons and they have been falsely implicated in this offence. Hew further submitted that applicant/accused No.1 is senior citizen and suffering from various diseases. He further submitted that at the time of execution of agreement to sale, applicants­accused have disclosed the facts in respect of remark of reservation and complainant agreed that he will remove remove the said remark. He further submitted that there is no evidence against the applicants­ accused to show their involvement in the alleged crime. He further submitted that entire case is based on documentary evidence, therefore, custodial interrogation of applicants­ accused is not necessary.\r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4. On the other hand, learned APP submitted that applicants/accused are having knowledge about the impugned land is reserved by Government, sold the same to the complainant, and accepted an earnest amount of Rs.3,50,000/­ for their own wrongful gain. He further submitted that if anticipatory bail is granted, misappropriated amount is remained to be seized. He further submitted that there is possibility that applicants­ accused will be pressurized to the prosecution witnesses. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5. On perusing police papers, prima facie, it reveals that applicant­ accused having knowledge about there is reservation on their land, though they agreed to sale the said land to the complainant and accepted Rs.3,50,000/­ as an earnest amount. Thus, it appears that since beginning, applicants/accused was having knowledge about their land was reserved by Government, it was not possible to remove the said reservation, even though, they agreed to sale the said land to the complainant by accepting amount of Rs.3,50,000/­ as an earnest amount. Thus, prima facie evidence of cheating is made out against the applicants­ accused. Moreover, it is seems that for recovery of alleged earnest amount, custodial interrogation of the applicants­ accused is necessary. Therefore, in my view, applicants ­accused are not entitled to be released on anticipatory bail. Hence, I pass following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER i. Application is rejected. \r\n---order-ends---\r\nDate :23/01/2019 (K.D.Vadane) Additional Sessions Judge, Pune. 3 “I affirm that the contents of the PDF file order are same word to word as per original judgment.” Name of Steno : Shri S.
