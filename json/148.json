So far as allegations against present applicant/accused is concerned, it appears that at the relevant time of incident, he has parked impugned vehicle on public place causing obstruction to the traffic and moreover, after alleged incident, he along with the said car fled away from the spot of incident. In the FIR, there is nothing mentioned about present applicant/accused has threatened to the complainant or anything. Therefore, in my view by imposing some conditions i.e. attending the Police Station and to cooperate the Investigating Officer in the investigation, if the present applicant ­accused is released on anticipatory bail, no prejudice will be caused to the prosecution. Hence, application deserves to be allowed. Therefore, I pass the following order.",

Ahiwale was on duty of controlling traffic, at that time, complainant asked to driver i.e. present applicant/accused of Fortuner car bearing registration No.MH/12/QT/0325 to take his vehicle outside PMT Bus depot. At that time, accused No.1­ Pappu Bhandari stated quarreling with complainant by saying that \u0027\u0027 मम गगडम कगढणगर नगहम ततमहगलग मगझम कगय उपटगयचम तत उपटग, मम भगरतमय यतवग सतनतचग पतणत शहर अधययकक आहत\u0027\u0027 and rushed on the person of the complainant and manhandled him, and thereafter, present applicant/accused fled away with the said car from the said place. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3. Learned advocate for applicant/accused submitted that applicant/accused has not committed any offence. He further submitted that custodial interrogation of applicant/accused is not necessary.

On the other hand learned APP submitted that present applicant/accused after alleged incident along with said car fled away and investigation in respect of same is yet to be completed, therefore, his anticipatory bail application be rejected. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5. On perusing police papers, prima facie, it reveals that on 08/01/2019 at about 09­30, complainant­ PSI­ B.
