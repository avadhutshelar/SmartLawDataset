  "processedText": "Cri.Bail Application no.126/19 CNR-MHPU01-000526-2019 ORDER BELOW EXH.1 \r\n---header-ends---\r\n1] Perused application and say. Heard Advocate for applicant and APP for the State. 2] This is first bail application filed under section 438 of Cr.P.C. by applicant in respect of apprehension of his arrest in C.R. no. 8/19 registered at Shirur Police Station for the offence punishable under section 354 of the Indian Penal Code and under section 7,8 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. \r\n---background-ends---\r\nIt is alleged that victim aged about 17 years lodged report stating that applicant is husband of her sister. On 04.01.2019 she was alone in house. Her mother and sister went to Krishnai Hospital, Tandali, applicant came to her house and demanded hot water for bathing, she gave it. Then he asked her where her mother was, victim replied that her step mother Sunanda went in land property. Then applicant pulled her, hold her hand and pulled her near him and told that he want to marry with her. She then shouted. Her cousin came and rescued her. Applicant thereby outraged her modesty. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3] According to applicant, he is falsely implicated in this matter. Applicant married with sister of victim and they have three children out of wedlock. Sister of victim is having illicit relationship with one Vikas Memane. Therefore, quarrel took place between applicant and his wife as he caught her raid handed on 03.01.2019. Applicant dropped his wife at her parents house but later on on 03.01.2019 at 5.00 p.m. he went to her parents house with car as children were missing her. On 04.01.2019 after medical treatment of wife of applicant he, his wife and children started travelling to Uruli Kanchan at the distance of 2 kms. family members of his wife stopped them and asked why he beat his wife Ranuka. There was scuffle between them. They assaulted applicant by means of wooden stick, iron rod, gave kick and fist blows. For that incident applicant filed First Information Report in Shirur Police Station for offences punishable under section 324,323,341,147,148,149,143 of the Indian Penal Code and to counter blast that complaint present report is filed by first informant only to defame applicant. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4] Applicant has not committed any offence as alleged. He is permanent resident of Haveli, Dist­Pune and has no criminal antecedents. His family members are depending on him. Due to levelling of offences punishable under section 354 of Indian Penal Code and section 7,8 of POCSO Act there is apprehension in his mind about the arrest. Therefore, he prayed to grant him protection under section 438 of Code of Criminal Procedure. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5] APP and I.O. objected application on the ground that investigation is in progress. Considering relationship applicant will pressurize victim and witnesses. There is possibility of tampering prosecution evidence. So, they prayed to reject the application. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6] Allegations against the applicant are serious. From statement of victim role attributed to applicant can be gathered. No doubt there are cross complaints and First Information Report of other offences on same day is filed on record. According to applicant due to filing of cross complaints he is falsely implicated. However, it appears that investigation in this matter is going on. Considering relationship there is every possibility of tampering prosecution evidence by giving threat and pressure to victim and witnesses. Moreover, material information is to be gathered from the applicant. Therefore, it is not proper to grant protection to applicant under section 438 of Code of Criminal procedure. Due to above reasons application deserves to be rejected with following order ­ \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER The application is rejected. \r\n---order-ends---\r\nPune.
