  "processedText": "Criminal Bail Application No. 197/2019 (CNR No. MHPU01­000732­2019) Nandkumar Kisan Gote Vs. State of Maharashtra (Through Loni Kalbhor P.S.) \r\n---header-ends---\r\nORDER BELOW EXH. 1 Applicant Nandkumar Kisan Gote has filed this application under Section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for the grant of Anticipatory Bail in connection with C.R.No. 1018/2018 under Section 420, 406, 504, 506 of the Indian Penal Code. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n[2] Perused the application and say filed by I.O. I have heard both the sides and perused the material placed on the record. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[3] In the year 2010 Rupee Co­op. Bank auctioned land bearing Gat No. 14 and 16. The applicant/accused offered purchased price of Rs.4,51,00,000/­ and issued a cheque as a token amount. Thereafter, one Dattatraya Gote met Sarfaroj Shaikh, who is the owner of land and made proposal to purchase said land along with the applicant. On 03.04.2010 the applicant and Dattatraya Gote had purchased Gat No. 14 and 16 from Sarfaroj and his wife for consideration of Rs.95 Lakhs. Accordingly, Gat No. 14 was purchased by accused and Gat No. 16 by Dattatraya Gote. Applicant has made full payment in cash. Dattatraya Gote had issued cheque, but the same was dishonoured. Therefore, Sarfaroj filed complaint against Dattatraya Gote and Applicant. The order of 156(3) of Cr.P.C for investigation was passed and case committed before J.M.F.C., Pune, vide RCC No. 228/2011. The applicant was acquitted. In the meantime, Sarfaroj filed Spl. Civil Suit No 1392/2010 at CJSD, Pune against Dattatraya Gote and applicant. The said suit is pending. In September – 2014 the informant Suresh Choudhari agreed to purchase 5 acres of land from Gat No. 14. Applicant had executed Agreement to Sale and Power of Attorney in favour of informant. In the Agreement, it is mentioned about pendency of above mentioned civil suit and loan of Rupee Bank on the said land. The applicant has been falsely implicated in various cases by informant and his friends. The applicant is also falsely implicated by Rupraj Pengase, who is friend of informant Raman Choudhari. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[4] The Ld. Counsel for Applicant stated that, the applicant is innocent and has not committed any offence. The custodial interrogation of the applicant is not required. Nothing incriminating has to be discovered or recovered at the instance of applicant. On the report of Rohit Tupe in C.R. No. 932/2019, the Hon’ble High Court Bombay granted anticipatory bail to the applicant by Order dated 07.01.2019. Similarly in Crime No. 211/2016 on a report of Laxman Mane, the offence u/s. 420, 437, 438, 120­B of IPC was registered against the applicant. In the said complaint, main accused is informant and applicant is shown as accused only because, he was witness to Sale Deed No.6374/2014. The applicant has been released on anticipatory bail. The entire case is based on documentary evidence. The custodial interrogation of the applicant is not necessary. Hence, prayed for anticipatory bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[5] On the other hand, the Ld. APP submitted that there is prima facie accusation against this applicant. The custodial interrogation of the applicant is required for purpose of investigation. He may tamper the prosecution evidence. The applicant/accused has been involved in 3­4 criminal cases of similar nature. The detail interrogation of the applicant is necessary for fair investigation. It submitted that, looking to the gravity of the offence, the application is liable to be rejected. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[6] After hearing the Ld. Counsel for the applicant and Ld. APP, it reveals that, the entire case is based on documentary evidence. The said transaction pertains to civil nature. In other two crimes, the applicant has been released on anticipatory bail. The custodial interrogation of applicant is not necessary for the purpose of investigation. The applicant is ready to co­operate the investigating agency, as and when required. Considering the facs and circumstances of the case, there is no hurdle to grant anticipatory bail to the applicant by imposing suitable conditions. Hence, I proceed to pass the following order :­ \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nO R D E R [1] Application (Exh.1) is allowed. [2] Ad­interim protection granted is hereby confirmed. [3] In the event of arrest of the applicant ­ Nandkumar Kisan Gote in the matter of C.R.No. 1018/2018 under Section : 4 : 420, 406, 504, 506 of the Indian Penal Code registered at Loni Kalbhor Police Station, Pune, he be released on his executing P.R.
