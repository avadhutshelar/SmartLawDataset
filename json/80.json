Moreover, from the police papers, it reveals that during 4 period of September 2018 to 26/12/2018, 477 mobile phone call and 129 messages took place on the mobile phone of arrested accused­ Rohit Shende and present applicant/accused with each other, there was talk took place between them for a period 41747 seconds. Moreover, from the statement of Dattatray Dawar, who is working as Junior Clerk of Land Record office, Pune, it reveals that in CTS appeal No.4375/2018, arrested accused­Rohit Shende was not appointed as an Advocate by either party even though he was remaining present in that matter. Moreover, Dattatray Dawar in his statement stated that applicant/accused asked him to make discussion with arrested ­accused­Rohit Shende, in respect of impugned matter,and accordingly after 07­30 p.m., one person took him at the office of arrested accused­Rohit Shende, and made discussion about the said matter. Thus, from the statement of Dattatray Dawar, prima facie that arrested accused­Rohit Shende was not advocate of either party in impugned matter, but he was in contact with present applicant/accused. Moreover, it appears that before taking entry in Outward register, copy of pending work was handed over to accused ­Rohit Shende as per direction of present applicant­accused. Therefore, considering Call Detail Record collected by Investigating officer, prima facie it appears that though arrested accused­Rohit Shende is not appointed by either party in CTS appeal No.4375/2018, he was in contact with present applicant/accused. Moreover, as per prosecution case, arrested­accused­Rohit Shende accepted impugned bribe amount from the complainant as an agent of the present applicant/accused, this act on the part of applicant/accused not come within discharging official function or duties, therefore, section 17­A of the Prevention of Corruption Act is not attracted. Moreover, in the present case, prima facie, it reveals that applicant/accused is also invovled in the case, in which co­accused­Rohit Shende was arrested 5 on the spot while accepting bribe amount. Therefore, in such circumstances, mandate of previous sanction as per section 17­A of the Prevention of Corruption Act is not applicable to the facts and circumstances of case. Moreover, it appears that impugned investigation is at very crucial stage. It also appears that taking into consideration huge amount of bribe and gravity of offence interrogation of present applicant about how much officers of his department are involved in the alleged commission of offence, is necessary.",

Bail application No. 94/2019 1. This is an application U/s.438 of Cr.P.C. filed by the applicant­accused for grant of anticipatory bail in connection with Crime No.392/2018, registered with Bundgarden Police Station for the offence punishable u/s. 7A and 12 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2. Prosecution case is that on 22/11/2018, original complainant­Umesh More lodged report with Anti­Corruption Bureau, Pune, alleging in that accused­Rohit Shende made demand of bribe amount of Rs. 2 crore, for getting decision from present applicant/accused­Dy. Director of Land Records in respect of CTS appeal No.4375/2018 and in negotiations, the applicant/accused agreed to accept bribe amount of Rs.1,70,00,000/­, and thereby ACB, Pune by following due procedure, caught accused­Rohit Shende while accepting bribe amount. Moreover, as per prosecution case, present applicant/accused and arrested accused­Rohit Shende hatched conspiracy and accused­Rohit Shende was arrested while accepting bribe amount. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3. Learned counsel for applicant/accused submitted that applicant­accused has not committed any offence, he has been falsely implicated in this crime. He further submitted that applicant/accused never met to Umesh More, never demanded amount of bribe to him. He further submitted that present applicant/accused was not present on scene of offence when ACB, Pune arrested to accused­Rohit Shende. He further submitted that Investigating officer has already 2 recorded statement of present applicant/accused, therefore, his custodial interrogation is not necessary. He further submitted applicant/accused has discharged his official duties relating to the case in­question and passed appropriate order on merit, therefore, no any investigation can be carried out against him without previous approval as required u/s. 17­A of Prevention of Corruption Act. He further submitted that alleged telephonic conversations are much before incident and those cannot be considered as legal evidence to implicate applicant/accused. Investigating officer with malafide intention added name of present applicant/accused in alleged crime without any sufficient evidence. He further submitted that applicant/accused is suffering from heart disease and he was admitted in Sassoon hospital and thereafter to Jahangir Hospital in ICU. He further submitted that as custodial interrogation of present applicant/accused is not necessary, therefore, he be released on anticipatory bail. In support of his submission, learned advocate of applicant/accused has relied on the rulings 1)Sanjay Awasthi Vs. State of Uttar Pradesh and another ( 2015 DGLS (SC) 1300, 2) Chenna Boyanna Krishna Yadav Vs. State of Maharashtra and another ( 2006 DGLS (SC) 1135) 3)Shobhan Singh Khanka Vs. The State of Jharkhand (2012 DGLS (SC) 178) 4) Sanjay R. Chavan Vs. Dattatray G. Phalke and others ( 2015 (DGLS) 69). \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4. On the other hand, learned APP submitted that accused­ Rohit Shende and present applicant/accused hatched conspiracy, and thereafter, the accused­ Rohit Shende was caught raid handed while accepting bribe amount. He further submitted that during the period September 2018 to 26th December 2018, there were 477 mobile calls and 129 message took place between arrested accused and present applicant/accused, and they were talking each other for a period of 41747 seconds. This implicitly shows that arrested accused is having 3 very close relation with the present applicant/accused. He further submitted that applicant/accused in his statement stated that he is not having any relations with the accused­Rohit Shende, however fron CDR report and statement of witnesses, it reveals that applicant/ accused is having close relations with arrested accused­Rohit Shende. He further submitted that Dattatray Dawar­ Junior clerk of Land Records in his statement before Investigating officer specifically stated that applicant/accused asked him to go to office of arrested accused­Rohit Shende and discuss in respect of impugned matter pending before Dy. Director of Land Records. He further submitted that during investigation , it is also disclosed that present applicant/accused asked Shri. Dattatray Dawar to hand over copy of pending case to accused Rohit Shende before taking its entry in the Outward Register. He further submitted that section 17­A of Prevention of Corruption Act is not applicable in this matter because this is case involving arrest on spot on charge of accepting and attempting to accept in undue advantage. He further submitted that section 17­A is applicable only in case, decision taken by public servant in discharge of official function or duties, but demand and accepting bribe amount not come in purview of discharge of official function and duties. He further submitted that custodial interrogation of applicant/accused is necessary to make enquiry with present applicant/accused about how copy of appeal received by arrested accused­Rohit Shende, and how much other persons are involved in the alleged commission of offence. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5. On perusing police papers, prima facie, it reveals that on the basis of complaint dated 22/11/2018 lodged by Umesh More, after due verification, on 26/12/2018, raid was carried by ACB, Pune and caught accused­Rohit Shende while accepting bribe amount. Moreover, from the police papers, it reveals that during 4 period of September 2018 to 26/12/2018, 477 mobile phone call and 129 messages took place on the mobile phone of arrested accused­ Rohit Shende and present applicant/accused with each other, there was talk took place between them for a period 41747 seconds. Moreover, from the statement of Dattatray Dawar, who is working as Junior Clerk of Land Record office, Pune, it reveals that in CTS appeal No.4375/2018, arrested accused­Rohit Shende was not appointed as an Advocate by either party even though he was remaining present in that matter. Moreover, Dattatray Dawar in his statement stated that applicant/accused asked him to make discussion with arrested ­accused­Rohit Shende, in respect of impugned matter,and accordingly after 07­30 p.m., one person took him at the office of arrested accused­Rohit Shende, and made discussion about the said matter. Thus, from the statement of Dattatray Dawar, prima facie that arrested accused­Rohit Shende was not advocate of either party in impugned matter, but he was in contact with present applicant/accused. Moreover, it appears that before taking entry in Outward register, copy of pending work was handed over to accused ­Rohit Shende as per direction of present applicant­accused. Therefore, considering Call Detail Record collected by Investigating officer, prima facie it appears that though arrested accused­Rohit Shende is not appointed by either party in CTS appeal No.4375/2018, he was in contact with present applicant/accused. Moreover, as per prosecution case, arrested­accused­Rohit Shende accepted impugned bribe amount from the complainant as an agent of the present applicant/accused, this act on the part of applicant/accused not come within discharging official function or duties, therefore, section 17­A of the Prevention of Corruption Act is not attracted. Moreover, in the present case, prima facie, it reveals that applicant/accused is also invovled in the case, in which co­accused­Rohit Shende was arrested 5 on the spot while accepting bribe amount. Therefore, in such circumstances, mandate of previous sanction as per section 17­A of the Prevention of Corruption Act is not applicable to the facts and circumstances of case. Moreover, it appears that impugned investigation is at very crucial stage. It also appears that taking into consideration huge amount of bribe and gravity of offence interrogation of present applicant about how much officers of his department are involved in the alleged commission of offence, is necessary. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6. Moreover, facts in case in hand and that of supra cases, on which learned advocate for applicant/accused is relied, are somewhat different. Therefore, observations of supra cases are not applicable to the facts and circumstances of the case in hand. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n7. Taking into consideration all above facts, in my view, applicant­accused is not entitled to release on anticipatory bail. Hence, I pass following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER i. Application (Exh.1) is rejected. \r\n---order-ends---\r\nDate : 11/01/2019 (K.D.Vadane) Additional Sessions Judge, Pune. 6 “I affirm that the contents of the PDF file order are same word to word as per original judgment.” Name of Steno : Shri S.
