  "processedText": "O in BA No.162/19 CNR­MHPU01­000605­2019 ORDER BELOW EXH.1 IN BAIL APPLN. No.162/2019 (Passed on 11­01­2019) \r\n---header-ends---\r\n1] This is an application U/sec. 439 of Cr.P.C. for grant of bail to applicant­accused Nivrutti Muktaji Pansare in CR No.145/2018 registered with Shivajinagar police station, U/sec. 420, 465, 466, 467, 468, 471, 120(B) r/w 34 of Indian Penal Code, 1860. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2] Heard Ld. Counsel on behalf of applicant­accused and Ld. APP. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3] Prima­facie from record and submissions of Ld. Counsel on behalf of both parties it is found that informant Vinay Vivek Arhana and his father Vivek Arhana are running Rozary Education Society and they are partners of the said education society. They had engaged Adv. Sagar Suryawanshi as their legal advisor for the work of their said education society and even for other legal advise including finance etc. He had compelled informant to make a facility agreement with his wife Sheetal Tejwani, which was later on cancelled. They both have falsely represented to informant that they are owner of land S.No. 394/2 at Talegaon and convinced the informant to purchase the said land. The informant purchased their land and mortgaged the same with Cosmos Bank. But, later on it is found that they are not owners of said land. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4] Adv. Sagar Suryawanshi, his wife Sheetal Tejwani and present applicant Adv. Priyanaka Shelar in collusion with each other have prepared false affidavits and papers of the informant for Rozary Education Society and thereby filed false special civil suit no. 1598/15. But on enquiry, it is found that, they have forged the affidavit, documents and vakalatnama with signature of informant and thereby filed said false suit on the basis of forged documents. Those false affidavits were notarized before the present applicant­accused and besides that applicant has no role in this crime. It is alleged that, the informant has never instructed to Adv. Sagar Suryawanshi for filing the said suit, nor he has executed affidavits before Notary. He has not signed vakilpatra, but, his all the signatures are forced on so many documents and the said suit was filed. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5] The applicant was arrested in this crime on 02.01.2019. In any case the record prima­facie does not show the breach of trust or fraud of crores of rupees cash by the applicant. Now even though the property or documents of lacs or crores of rupees are involved in the suit, but prima­facie at the most the role of applicant is notrising of the affidavits and not more than that. Now some of the documents are in the court. The police failed to recover any document from applicant. Therefore, no purpose is going to be served by keeping the applicant behind the bar. Therefore, in my opinion it would be just and proper to grant bail to applicant on some conditions. Hence the order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER [1] The application (Exh.1) is allowed. [2] The applicant­accused Nivrutti Muktaji Pansare is released on bail in C.R. No.145/2018 registered with Shivajinagar police station, U/sec. 420, 465, 466, 467, 468, 471, 120(B) r/w 34 of Indian Penal Code, 1860 on furnishing of his P.B. and S.B. of Rs. 15000/­. [3] He shall cooperate to the investigation and attend the concerned police station during day hours if called by I.O. in writing for the purpose of further investigation, if any, till filing of the charge­ sheet. [4] He shall not tamper to the prosecution witnesses. [5] Bail before concerned Ld. J.M.F.C. \r\n---order-ends---\r\n( S.K.Karhale ) Dt. 11.01.2019.
