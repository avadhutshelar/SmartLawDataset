  "processedText": "ORDER BELOW EX. NO. 1 IN CRI. BAIL APPLN. NO. 19/2019. (CNR No. MHPU01­000071 ­2019) Nikhil Ashok Raut Vs. The State of Maharashtra (PSO Saswad P.S.) \r\n---header-ends---\r\n[1] This is first bail application under Section 439 of Cr.P.C. for the grant of bail to Applicant ­Nikhil Ashok Raut for the offences punishable under Section 307, 504 and 506 of the Indian Penal Code in C.R. No.684/2018 registered at Saswad Police Station, District – Pune. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n[2] Perused the application and say filed by I.O. I have heard both the sides and perused the material placed on the record. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[3] Prosecution case in short is as under:­ On 12.12.2018 at about 10.30 p.m. the informant Umesh Raut and his wife Sangita Raut took meal after closing their vegetable shop. Thereafter, the informant started wood cutting. Thereon, Ashok Raut and his wife Kalpana Raut came outside the house and told them not to cut wood and due to noise, they could not sleep. On that account, the son of Ashok Raut namely Nikhil (Applicant) came at there and abused to informant and his wife. The Applicant assaulted the complainant and his wife with koyta on account of noise of wood cutting machine. The wife of informant Sangita intervened the altercation of words. The applicant also assaulted to Sangita Raut. Due to that, the informant Umesh Raut and his wife Sangita sustained injuries. On these allegations, the accused was prosecuted. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[4] The Ld. Counsel for the Applicant submitted that, the applicant has not committed any offence, but he has been falsely implicated in this crime with ulterior motive. The injuries sustained to informant Umesh Raut and his wife Sangita are simple in nature. The ingredient of Section 307 of IPC are not attracted in the present fact of the case, as the injuries sustained are not come within the purview of this section. The applicant is only aged about 22 years. If he remained in jail with hardcore criminals, then his life will be spoiled. The investigation is practically completed. The further custody of the applicant is not required for any other purpose. He is ready to co­operate with the investigating agency. He is ready to abide all the terms and conditions, which will be imposed by the Court. On these grounds, he prayed to release him on bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[5] On the other hand, the Ld. APP submitted that there is prima facie accusation against the applicant. If the applicant is released on bail, then possibility of committing of any other cognizable offence cannot be ruled out. If the applicant is released on bail, then, possibility of his absconding and tampering of prosecution evidence cannot be ruled out. The investigation is at primary stage. The co­accused is absconding. If applicant released on bail, then, he may create hurdle in arrest of co­accused. It is submitted that, looking to the gravity of the offence, the application is liable to be rejected. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[6] After considering this submission of both the sides and perusing the material placed on record, it reveals that, Investigation is practically completed. The applicant is aged about 22 years. I had gone through the injury certificate of informant Umesh and his wife Sangita. The alleged injury are simple in nature. The ingredients of Section 307 of IPC are not prima facie find out. The applicant is in custody since 13.12.2018. He is ready to abide by each and every conditions imposed by this Court. Considering the facts and circumstance of this case, there is no hurdle to release the applicant on bail by imposing certain conditions. Hence, I proceed to pass the following order :­ \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nO R D E R [1] Application (Exh.1) is allowed. [2] Applicant/accused ­ Nikhil Ashok Raut is released on bail for the offences punishable under Section 307, 504 and 506 of the Indian Penal Code in C.R.
