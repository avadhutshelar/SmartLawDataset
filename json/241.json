  "processedText": "ORDER BELOW EXH. 1 IN CRI. BAIL APPLICATION No. 44/2019 (Sahdev Jagnnath Jadhav and others Vs. State of Maharashtra) CNR : MHST01­000263­2019 \r\n---header-ends---\r\n1) This is an application for grant of pre­arrest bail in connection with C.R. No. 496/2018 registered with Phaltan City police station for the offences punishable under sections 326, 504 and 506 r/w. 34 of Indian Penal Code, 1860. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2) It is the case of prosecution that, the first informant Bapu Shankar Madane has lodged report that, on 23/12/2018 at about 6:00 p.m., the applicant No. 1 alongwith Hanamant Sahdev Jadhav came into his courtyard suspecting the first informant had abused them while keeping his hen in the cadge and started abusing him. Applicant No. 1 pelted stone towards the first informant, but it was missed. The accused Suraj Jadhav and Hanmant Jadhav assaulted the first informant by means of sticks on his head. Accused Mahesh Jadhav assaulted him by means of knife on his left hand elbow. When the nephew of first informant by name Dada Shankar Madane came to rescuing accused Hanmant Jadhav assaulted him by means of stick, while the wife of one Dada Jadhav rescued him from the clutches of accused persons. Hence, he lodged report with the police station. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3) Per contra, it is the contention of applicants/accused that, the name of applicant No. 2 is not appearing in the FIR. The first informant and the witnesses in present C.R. and the accused persons are resident of same village. They are knowing each other and their full names, however in the FIR, the first informant has stated name of one of the accused as \u0027Mahesh Sahdev Jadhav\u0027 whereas the applicant No. 2\u0027s name is \u0027Mahesh Mahadev Jadhav\u0027. Apparently, there is difference in the name of father of applicant No. 2. There is no explanation by the prosecution side about the discrepancy appearing in the FIR in respect of the name of applicant No. 2. In the circumstances, applicant No. 2 can be granted order of pre­arrest bail. Since his name is not appearing in the FIR, however there is direct allegations appearing in the FIR against applicant No. 1 Sahdev Jagnnath Jadhav. The first informant assigned him role that he pelted stones towards him, but he somehow missed it. Though the injurious mentioned in the injury certificate are simple in nature, however considering the role attributed to the applicant No.1, he is not entitled for grant of pre­arrest bail. In the circumstances, following order is passed. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER 1) Criminal Bail Application No. 44/2019, is partly allowed. 2) In the event of arrest of applicant No. 2 Mahesh Mahadev Jadhav, he be released on bail on executing Personal Bond of Rs.15,000/­ (Fifteen Thousand) with surety of like amount in connection with C.R. No. 496/2018 registered with Phaltan City police station. 3) The prayer for granting of pre­arrest bail in favour of applicant No. 1 Sahdev Jagnnath Jadhav is hereby rejected. 4) Applicant No. 2 Mahesh Mahadev Jadhav shall not tamper prosecution witnesses and co­operate the investigating officer. 5) Ad­interim order dated 24/01/2019 passed by this Court is hereby confirmed. 6) Application is disposed­of accordingly. \r\n---order-ends---\r\n(N.L.
