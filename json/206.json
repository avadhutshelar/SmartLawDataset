Order passed below Exh.1 in Cri.M.A.No.6 of 2019. 01.\r\n---header-ends---\r\n The applicant by this application under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure prays for bail in C.R.No.563 of 2018 registered with Phaltan Rural Police Station under Sections 307, 326 r/w 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860, and Sections 3, 25, 27 of the Arms Act. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n02. Perused the application and say filed by the prosecution at Exh.4. Gone through the investigation papers. Heard learned Advocate for the applicant and the learned A.P.P. for the State. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n03. It is vehemently argued by the learned Advocate for the applicant that, applicant not fired the injured, hence no question of recovery arose. Motive is not duly proved. The election of village Gunavare had been taken place in the year 2015. Accused is arrested on 31.12.2018 and from 02.01.2019 accused is in MCR. According to applicant, at the most allegations against applicant are that, on 28.12.2018, at about 05.00 to 06.00 p.m., while complainant was on way towards village Barad on his motorcycle, complainant saw the applicant on Barad â€“ Gunavare road near Miravali Peer and at relevant time, an unidentified person opened fire on complainant by means of firearm. This is the only allegation mentioned in FIR against applicant. There is no specific role of applicant and his presence is not identified in investigation. There is no reference of CCTV footage in FIR. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n04. It is vehemently argued by learned A.P.P. that, incident had taken place on 28.12.2018 and immediately FIR is lodged. The presence of applicant on the spot of incident is prima facie proved. CCTV footage also indicates the presence of applicant. Investigation is in progress. Description of unidentified accused is stated. Offence is serious. If applicant is released on bail, the weapon used in alleged offence cannot be recovered and absconding accused cannot be traced out. The pistol and motorcycle used in the alleged offence is yet to be recovered. During investigation applicant deliberately avoided to disclose the name of two unknown associates. If applicant is released on bail, he will misuse his liberty. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n05. I have gone through the investigation papers. From the statement of complainant which was recorded before Medical Officer of Nikop Hospital dated 28.12.2018, at about 07.10 p.m., it reveals that, there are indifferences between complainant, Dayanand Sadashiv Gavade, Vijay Sadashiv Gavade on account of election. There are complaints between them on account of election. On 28.12.2018, at about 05.00 to 06.00 p.m., when complainant was proceeding from Barad â€“ Gunavare road and was near Meeravali Peer, he saw applicant and some unknown person came from back side of applicant and fired from the back side of complainant by saying that, why complainant is troubling Gavade Saheb. FIR indicates the same story. From the statement of complainant dated 29.12.2018, it reveals that, applicant and two unknown persons came on motorcycle from back side of complainant. Applicant was on one motorcycle and unknown persons were on another motorcycle. Applicant was stating unknown persons that, Gavade Saheb told to assault the complainant and said fact was listened by the complainant. The description of unknown assailants was mentioned in statement dated 29.12.2018. From the statement of Deepak Tembre dated 29.12.2018, it reveals that, on 28.12.2018, from 06.30 a.m., Deepak was in his hotel. At about 05.15 p.m. applicant came to him on his motorcycle and they were discussing in respect of agricultural land. From the statement of Vaishnavi, it reveals that, applicant went to Barad on his motorcycle after sending her at house. From the statement of Prakash Tatyaba Jadhav, dated 30.12.2018, it reveals that, complainant told Prakash that, the persons of Gavade Saheb opened fire on him. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n06. It is not the allegation of prosecution that, applicant fired on complainant. According to the case of prosecution, the unknown assailants who were with applicant fired the complainant. As far as question of prima facie presence of the applicant is concerned, on the basis of statement of complainant, statement of Vaishnavi, it can be said that, the applicant was present when complainant was fired. The allegations in complaint further reveals that, incident took place on account of previous quarrel. Prima facie from the presence of applicant, it reveals that, there is involvement of applicant in the alleged offence. Yet, unknown assailants are not arrested. The pistol and motorcycle used in the commission of alleged offence are not seized. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n07. Moreover, from the record, it reveals that, yet complainant is admitted in Nikop Hospital, Phaltan, as an indoor patient. Applicant and complainant are resident of same village. Yet chargeÂ­sheet is not filed and investigation is not completed. The unknown accused are absconding since the date of offence. If the applicant is released on bail the possibility cannot be ruled out that, he with the help of absconding accused will vanish the evidence. If applicant is released on bail, he may make any inducement, promise or threat to the persons acquainted with the facts so as to dissuade them from disclosing the fact before the police. Though there is no reference of CCTV footage in FIR, at this stage it cannot be said that, complainant was knowing anything as to the CCTV footage. In my mind, investigation is in progress. The alleged offence is serious in nature and if applicant is released on bail the possibility cannot be ruled out that, he will misuse his liberty. If applicant is released on bail there will be difficulty to arrest the absconding accused. Prima facie from the record, it reveals that, the presence of applicant with unidentified accused who fired on the complainant is proved. Hence, I am of the opinion that, prima facie no case is made out by applicant to release him on bail. Hence, I proceed to pass the following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER Application stands rejected. \r\n---order-ends---\r\nSatara. (N.D.Khose) Date : 14.01.2019. Addl. Sessions Judge, Satara."
