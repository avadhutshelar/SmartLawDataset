Therefore, he prayed for anticipatory bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3) The prosecution has filed say at Exh.5 and resisted the application. It is contended that, informant\u0027s husband had borrowed loan of Rs. 2,50,000/足 from applicant and accused Ali Sayyad and in spite of fulfillment of the same with interest, applicant and accused Ali Sayyad were demanding money from him, therefore, he committed suicide by hanging himself. A chit was found on the person of the deceased shows names of applicant Anwar and accused Ali. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4) Advocate for applicant argued that, applicant is innocent person, having no connection with this alleged offence and he falsely involved by this complaint. He has no criminal background, he will co足operate with the investigation machinery and will abide every condition imposed by the Court.

It is submitted that, if the applicant is released on bail, he will not attend the police station and will not cooperate in the investigation. It is further submitted that, applicant is running illegal business of Sawkari and in case of bail, he may indulge himself in such type of offences, so also major part of the investigation such as to collect specimen signature and hand writing of the applicant etc. is to be completed. Hence, he submitted for rejection of the application. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6) Considering the submissions I have to mention that, the allegation is that, the amount was obtained by the deceased from applicant accused and Ali Sayyad and they were putting pressure on the deceased for recovery of amount despite he has repaid huge amount. They were insisting for principal and interest amount. The FIR reflects that on inquiry made by the informant and deceased, these two accused persons have informed that, amount of interest was obtained by the deceased till that day Rs.2,50,000/足 were balance and monthly Rs.25,000/足 interest was also balance.
