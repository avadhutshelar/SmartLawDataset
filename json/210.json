State of Maharashtra) CNR : MHST01-000095-2019 \r\n---header-ends---\r\n1) Present application is filed by the applicant under section 438 of Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 apprehending his arrest as a result of complaint dated 05.01.2019 filed by Rehana Ashpak Shaikh, suspecting applicant\u0027s involvement in the accidental death of her husband Manjar Mohammad Hasan. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2) It is contended that, the deceased had taken loan of Rs.2,50,000/­ from accused Ali Sayyad and this applicant for business which was repaid by deceased with interest. However, this applicant and accused Ali Sayyad demanded repayment of loan. Thereafter, on 04.01.2019, deceased hanged himself. It is contended that, applicant is innocent person and falsely involved by the complainant due to business rivalry. Further it is contended that, there is no evidence to show that, applicant has abetted the commission of suicide, so also there is no instigation, aid or conspiracy to commit suicide. It is contended that applicant is permanent resident on the given address hence, there is no question of absconding. Therefore, he prayed for anticipatory bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3) The prosecution has filed say at Exh.5 and resisted the application. It is contended that, informant\u0027s husband had borrowed loan of Rs. 2,50,000/­ from applicant and accused Ali Sayyad and in spite of fulfillment of the same with interest, applicant and accused Ali Sayyad were demanding money from him, therefore, he committed suicide by hanging himself. A chit was found on the person of the deceased shows names of applicant Anwar and accused Ali. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4) Advocate for applicant argued that, applicant is innocent person, having no connection with this alleged offence and he falsely involved by this complaint. He has no criminal background, he will co­operate with the investigation machinery and will abide every condition imposed by the Court. It is further contended that, the bail application moved by other accused are allowed, therefore, on the ground of parity, this accused be released on bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5) A.P.P. submitted that, there are allegations against the applicant that he has charged huge interest and recovered from the deceased, he exploited the deceased which resulted into abetment of suicide. It is submitted that, if the applicant is released on bail, he will not attend the police station and will not cooperate in the investigation. It is further submitted that, applicant is running illegal business of Sawkari and in case of bail, he may indulge himself in such type of offences, so also major part of the investigation such as to collect specimen signature and hand writing of the applicant etc. is to be completed. Hence, he submitted for rejection of the application. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6) Considering the submissions I have to mention that, the allegation is that, the amount was obtained by the deceased from applicant accused and Ali Sayyad and they were putting pressure on the deceased for recovery of amount despite he has repaid huge amount. They were insisting for principal and interest amount. The FIR reflects that on inquiry made by the informant and deceased, these two accused persons have informed that, amount of interest was obtained by the deceased till that day Rs.2,50,000/­ were balance and monthly Rs.25,000/­ interest was also balance. This applicant has disclosed the informant about the Bhishi transaction. Thus, the allegations are mainly against the applicant accused and Ali Sayyad. Therefore, his presence may be necessary for interrogation. Hence, I am not inclined to grant pre­ arrest bail to this applicant. Considering the role of accused ground of parity cannot be said to be available to this applicant. Hence, I pass following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER 1) Criminal Misc. Application No. 10 of 2019 is rejected. \r\n---order-ends---\r\n(B.S.Wavre) Place : Satara Addl. Sessions Judge Date : 22nd January, 2019 Satara"
