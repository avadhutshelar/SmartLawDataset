At about 4.00 a.m., Manohardas Vaishnav Bhaiyya had been to the house of Reena and informed that there if fire to her Moped motorcycle. Immediately she along with others rushed to the spot and extinguished the fire. Salman Nashir Shaikh had told that Papa @ Altmes Qureshi and his friend Pallya @ Omkar Parmar, Shahid Shiraz Qureshi have caused mischief to the Moped by fire and he has noticed them while running from the spot by silver coloured Tavera No. MH 12 PF 9675. They have caused mischief of Rs. 50,000/Â­.

Name of Shahbaz Qureshi and Arbaz @ Malang Tundayya Shabbir Qureshi are not mentioned in FIR. There was enmity, which is double edged weapon Arbaz Shabbir Qureshi is handicapped by right hand. Altamez and Arbaz came to be arrested on 08.12.2018 and 11.12.2018 respectively whereas Shahabaz Siraz Qureshi is arrested on 02.01.2019. There was no reason behind their arrest. Since last two months they are in jail. Practically, investigation is completed. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4] Learned APP Shri. Salvi submitted that accused are having antecedents on their record. Accused Altamez @ Papa is facing 8 crimes, Arbaz Shabbir Qureshi is facing 15 crimes, whereas, Shahabaz Siraz Qureshi is facing 14 crimes, registered with different Police Stations. Tavera was used in commission of crime. Still Siraz Qureshi is absconding. They have committed the crime to create terror in the vicinity. There was enmity with one Tayade. Proposal for invoking the provisions of MOCCA Act against the accused persons to CR 3 No. 411/2018 of Khadki Police Station is sent. If the applicants are released on bail, they will tamper the prosecution witnesses. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5] Since the arrest of the applicant they are in jail. Practically the investigation might had completed and charge sheet is yet to be filed.
