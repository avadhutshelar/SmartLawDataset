  "processedText": "Cri Bail Application 224/2019 Criminal Bail Application No.224/2019 \r\n---header-ends---\r\nOrder Below Exh­ 1 (Passed on 18th January, 2019 ) CNR NO. MHPU01­000860­2019 Applicant/accused Rohit Hanmant Chavan moved the present bail application under section 439 of Code of Criminal Procedure for bail in Crime No. 809/2018 of Yerawada Police Station, Pune for the offence punishable under sections 353,332,336,143,147, 149 and 504 of Indian Penal Code .\r\n---background-ends---\r\n2] It is contended that Police Constable Kapil Bhakre and K.A. Choure were on duty. During patrolling on 07/08/2018 at about 23.00 hours they have received a call that some quarrel going on at Mother Terrasa Nagar, Gadital, Pune. They have immediately visited the said place and found about 150 to 200 people are there. Some people were using the crackers. They have asked them for not using it and to leave the place. Some people went to their house. However, 5 to 6 persons including Sai,Kunal Tunge, Jai Anthony with others stayed there and they were using fire crackers. Again they have been given understanding for not using it. However, they have manhandled them. However, they have started pelting stones on them. In the meanwhile PSI Gavari and other police staff came there. Looking to them those persons have fled from there. On the basis of such report offence as referred above came to be registered. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3] It is the case of the applicant accused that false allegations have been made against him. He has not committed any offence. There is no prima facie case. He is permanent resident of the given address. He is ready to co­operate and to abide with the terms. Other co­accused have already been released on bail by this court and therefore parity is applicable. He prayed for grant of bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4] The State has opposed the bail application by filing reply. It is contended that offence is serious in nature and possibility of tampering cannot be ruled out. State has prayed for rejection of the application. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5] Heard learned advocate for applicant and learned Additional Public Prosecutor. Perused the case papers made available by the State. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6] At the outset the learned advocate for the applicant/accused made a statement at Bar that this is a first bail application and earlier neither application for bail filed nor rejected. He further made a statement at Bar that with effect from 7th June 2018 the offence punishable under section 353 of Indian Penal Code is made non bailable and triable by the Court of Sessions by virtue of the Indian Penal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure ( Maharashtra Amendment) Act, 2017. Such a statement is accepted. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n7] Perusal of the FIR shows that the alleged incidence took place at about 23.00 hours of 07/11/2018. The report however, came to be lodged on next day at about 16.06 hours. It appears that all the material witnesses are police officials. Thus, prima facie no question arises in respect of tampering etc. It is also not the case of the State that some recovery has to be effected at the behest of applicant. It is thus clear that presence of applicant/accused is not required for investigation. Other co­ accused have also already been released on bail. The anxiety of learned Additional Public Prosecutor can be taken care of by imposing certain conditions. Considering the factual aspect of the matter as referred above alongwith nature, gravity of the offence coupled with punishment, application deserves to be allowed. Hence order.\r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER (1) Application is allowed. (2) The applicant/accused Rohit Hanmant Chavan be enlarged on bail on furnishing P.R. Bond in a sum of Rs. 15,000/­ with one surety in the like amount in Crime No.809/2018 of Police Station Yerawada, Pune for the offence punishable under sections 353, 332, 336, 143,147,149 and 504 of Indian Penal Code . (3) The applicant shall not interfere in the investigation and shall not pressurize the witnesses. (4) The applicant shall attend the concerned police station as and when called on written intimation till filing of the charge­ sheet. \r\n---order-ends---\r\nPune (M. R. Purwar) Dt. 18/01/2019 Addl.
