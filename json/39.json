She alleged that, prior to seven months, she got acquainted with Applicant at village Karegaon, Tal. Shirur. That time, Applicant took her mobile number and used to call her and used to assure her for marriage. At that time, on one day, when she was alone in the house of her Aunt, Applicant established physical relations with her by giving assurance of marriage. Thereafter, also Applicant committed sexual intercourse with her at Baburao Nagar, Shirur, Dist.Pune. However, on 15/11/2018, Applicant denied for marriage and threatened. Therefore, she lodged the report. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3] Applicant submits that, police arrested him on 16/11/2018. Since then he is behind the bars. Investigation is over. Further, Informant is married lady of 35 years, having sufficient level of understanding. Still she maintained relations with Applicant. Therefore, the relations were absolutely consensual. No offence of rape would attract in this matter. Applicant submits that, his further custody is not necessary. Therefore, he may be released on bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4] Learned APP Mr. Satpute appeared for Respondent/State and filed report of investigation officer. He submits that, offence is serious in nature. There are chances of tampering. Hence, the application may be rejected. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5] Heard the learned Adv. S. D Swami for Applicant and the learned APP Mr. Satpute for Respondent/State. Perused the Papers. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6] Prima facie, the Informant is major and married lady, having sufficient level of understanding. She is well aware about the consequences of her act. Still she did not file report against Applicant at the earliest. Further, I perused the medical examination report of Informant, her genital and private parts are shown to be normal.
