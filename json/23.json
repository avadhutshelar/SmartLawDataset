  "processedText": "CNR No.MHPU01­000070­2019 Omgiri Shamrav Gosavi Vs. State of Maharashtra (Samarth Police Station ) \r\n---header-ends---\r\nOrder below exh. 1 in Cri. Bail application No.27/2019 1. This is an application U/s.439 of Cr.P.C. filed by the applicant­accused for grant of bail in connection with Crime No.255/2018 , registered with Samarth Police Station for the offence punishable u/s.353, 332, 504, 506 of IPC. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2. Prosecution case is that on 28/12/2018 at about 12.30 a.m. at Narpatgiri chowk, in front of Royal Motors, Mangalwar peth, Pune, applicant/accused on count of somebody threw stone in front of his shop, shouted and abused, therefore, police staff tried to catch him, he abused, beat to the police persons by kicks and fist,and also threatened them. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3. Learned counsel for the applicant/accused submitted that applicant/accused has not committed any offence, he has been falsely implicated in this offence. He further submitted that there was no any motive or intention on the part of applicant/accused to commit offence. He further submitted that there is no recovery or discovery at the hands of applicant/accused, therefore, applicant be released on bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4. On the other hand, learned APP submitted that applicant/accused is habitual offender and he was externorated. He further submitted that applicant/accused assaulted, abused to the police persons, this shows that he is not law abiding person. He further submitted that if applicant/accused is released on bail, there is possibility of tampering the prosecution evidence. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5. On perusing police papers, prima facie, it reveals that on 2 28/12/2018 at about 12.30 a.m.at Narpatgiri chowk, in front of Royal Motors, Mangalwar peth, Pune, one Shetiba B. Shinde heard shouts, therefore, he came out of the house, at that time, he found applicant/accused was shouting in front of Royal motors and mob was gathered there, and they have asked the accused why he is shouting, meanwhile police arrived there, at that time, the applicant/accused rushed on their person and abused and threatened them. It seems that police have already recorded statement of witnesses. Nothing is required to be seized from the custody of applicant/accused. Thus, custodial interrogation of applicant is now not necessary. Therefore, considering all these aspects, in my view if present applicant ­accused is released on bail on certain conditions, no prejudice will be caused to the prosecution. Hence, I pass the following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER i. Application is allowed. ii. The applicant­ accused ­Omgiri Shamrav Gosavi be released on bail on furnishing P.R. Bond of Rs.25,000/­ (Rupees Twenty five Thousand Only) with one or two solvent sureties in like amount. iii. The applicant ­accused shall not tamper with prosecution evidence. iv. The applicant­accused shall attend concerned Police Station on every Monday and Thursday in between 11.00 a.m. to 2.00 p.m. till filing of the charge­sheet. v. The applicant­accused shall not leave Pune District without prior permission of this Court, till final disposal of the case. vi. The applicant­accused shall furnish fresh residential address to concerned Police Station and to this Court in case he changed present address. 3 vii. The applicant­accused shall attend the court regularly till final disposal of the case. \r\n---order-ends---\r\nDate : 14/01/2019 (K.D.Vadane) Additional Sessions Judge, Pune. 4 “I affirm that the contents of the PDF file Order are same word to word as per original judgment.” Name of Steno : Shri S.
