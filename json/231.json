It is vehemently argued by the learned Advocate for the applicant that, applicant is arrested on 13.01.2019 and now he is in MCR. Applicant is falsely involved in the alleged crime. Applicant is the only earning hand in his family. Applicant has no criminal background or never previously convicted.

It is vehemently argued by learned A.P.P. that, allegations against applicant are serious and he was found while manufacturing illicit liquor. Applicant succeeded to run away from the spot. Police seized 40 litres country made liquor and articles used for manufacturing illicit liquor. Relatives of applicant restrained police while they were discharging their duty of arresting the applicant and Crime No.10 of 2019 is registered against relatives of applicant. If applicant is released on bail he will repeat similar type of crime. There is likelihood of his absconding. Investigation is in progress. Yet absconding accused is to be arrested. Applicant will 2 Cri.M.A.No.34 of 2019. help the absconding accused. If applicant is released on bail he will definitely pressurise the witnesses.

From the complaint, it reveals that, on 12.01.2019, at about 05.30 p.m. within the vicinity of village Choudharwadi near the Morya Canal bridge accused and one unknown person was manufacturing illicit liquor with intent to cause hurt to such person and after noticing police flee away from the spot of incident.

From the say of learned A.P.P., it reveals that, if applicant is released on bail he will repeat same type of crime and there is likelihood of his absconding. Applicant will help the absconding accused and will pressurise the witnesses. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n07.
