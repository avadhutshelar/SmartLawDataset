The contents of FIR further clearly reveal that the accused persons along with other accused have illtreated the deceased for demand of dowry. It is a dowry death and she was being assaulted and illtreated for demand of amount. The death of deceased is doubtful. There are marks of assault on her body. Therefore, detailed investigation is necessary. Prima facie involvement of the accused appears in the offence in question. The investigation is in progress. The apprehension of the prosecution is well founded from the act of the accused. The offence is serious in nature. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n9] Considering these facts and considering the 5 Cri. B.A. No. 88/19. nature and gravity of offence, and the act committed by the applicants/accused, the applicants have not made out prima facie case for their release on bail. Therefore, it is not just and desirable to enlarge them on bail. Hence, I proceed to pass the following order :- \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER 1) Application (Exh.1) is hereby rejected. \r\n---order-ends---\r\n(Mrs. Madhuri M. Deshpande) Date: 24-1-2019.
