Prima facie it appears that applicant/accused along with co­ accused, in furtherance of their common intention by giving false promise to the complainant, allowed him to deposit amount in their bank accounts and thereby cheat to the complainant.

  "processedText": "CNR No.MHPU01­000326­2019 Aarti Gajratsingh Chaughan Vs. State of Maharashtra (Sinhgad road Police Station ) \r\n---header-ends---\r\nOrder below exh. 1 in Cri. Bail application No.83/2019 1. This is an application U/s.439 of Cr.P.C. filed by the applicant­ accused for grant of bail in connection with Crime No.685/2018 , registered with Sinhgad Road Police Station for the offence punishable u/s.419, 420 of IPC and u/s.66D of Information Technology Act, 2008. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2. Prosecution case is that one Parshuram Londhe lodged report at Sinhgad Road Police Station, alleging in that present applicant/accused and one Shubham D. Dixit told him that they are employees of Bajaj Home Loan Company and assured him that they will make available loan of Rs.15 lakh to him from Bajaj Home Loan Company, and they have contacted from various cell phones, and asked him to deposit amount for sanction of loan amount, therefore, he has deposited the amount of Rs.8,19,730/­ in the bank account of accused, and thereby cheated to the complainant. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3. Learned counsel for the applicant/accused submitted that applicant/accused has not committed any offence, she has been falsely implicated in this offence. He further submitted that only amount of Rs.35,450/­ deposited in the bank account of applicant/accused, and she is not beneficiary of the said amount. He further submitted that there is no direct evidence against present applicant/accused and nothing is recovered from her. He further submitted that investigation in respect of present applicant/accused is practically completed, therefore, her custodial interrogation is not necessary, therefore, she be released on bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4. On the other hand, learned APP submitted that present applicant/accused along with other co­ accused by telephonic message, asked complainant to deposit amount for sanction of loan to him and thereby cheated to the complainant. He further submitted that applicant/accused by her mobile No. 8318650741 made call to complainant and asked him to deposit amount in her bank account. He further submitted that investigation is in progress, therefore, if applicant/accused is released on bail, there is possibility of tampering the prosecution evidence. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5. On perusing police papers, prima facie, it reveals that on 10/12/2018, complainant lodged report at Sinhgad Road Police Station, alleging in that in the month of February 2018, he received telephonic message on his mobile about whether he is interested to take loan from Bajaj Home Loan company, and thereafter he again received various mobile calls from accused persons and as per their direction, he has deposited amount of Rs.8,27,435/­ in the bank account of accused Nos.1 and 2, however loan was not sanctioned to him. It appears that during investigation, it is disclosed that from mobile phone of present applicant/accused, there was call to complainant. Moreover, it appears that complainant has deposited an amount of Rs.31450/­ in the bank account of present applicant/ accused and amount of Rs.7,83,450/­ in the bank account of Shivam Sharma. Prima facie it appears that applicant/accused along with co­ accused, in furtherance of their common intention by giving false promise to the complainant, allowed him to deposit amount in their bank accounts and thereby cheat to the complainant. Moreover, it appears that investigation is yet to be completed. Therefore, in my view, though applicant/accused is lady, she is not to be released on bail at this stage. Therefore, application deserves to be rejected. Hence, I pass following order.\r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER i. Application is rejected. \r\n---order-ends---\r\nDate : 11/01/2019 (K.D.Vadane) Additional Sessions Judge, Pune. 4 “I affirm that the contents of the PDF file Order are same word to word as per original judgment.” Name of Steno : Shri S.
