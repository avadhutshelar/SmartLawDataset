Moreover, in the FIR, it is alleged co­ accused­Ritesh and Aniket have assaulted on victim with sickle, and present applicant gave kicks and fists blow to victim. Moreover, it seems that Investigating officer has seized blood stains clothes of presnt applicant/accused. Injuryh certificate shows that on 15/12/2018, injured­Tushaar was admitted in Bharati Vidhyapeeth hospital with history of assault by unknown persons, and he has sustained injuries to his both hands and head etc. So far as role played by present applicant/accused is concerned, he gave only kicks and fist blows to the victim. Moreover, it appears that nothing is remained to be seized from the custody of the applicant/accused. Moreover, custodial interrogation of the applicant/accused is now not necessary. Therefore, considering all these aspects, in my view if present applicant­accused is released on bail on certain conditions, no prejudice will be caused to the prosecution. Hence, I pass the following order.",

Bail application No.153/2109 1. This is an application U/s.439 of Cr.P.C. filed by the applicant­accused for grant of bail in connection with Crime No.346/2018, registered with Bibwewadi Police Station for the offence punishable u/s.307, 323, 504, 143, 147, 149 of IPC, u/s. 4(25) of the Arms Act and u/s. 37(1) r/w.s135 B of the Bombay Police Act. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2. Prosecution case is that on 15/12/2018 at about 12.30 a.m. to 01 a.m., when complainant was taking dinner at Punyai Lunch Home, present applicant/accused and other co­accused assaulted on him with deadly weapon,with intent to commit his murder and caused grievous injuries. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3. Learned counsel for the applicant/accused submitted that applicant/accused has not committed any offence and he has been falsely implicated in this offence. He further submitted that in the FIR, there is allegation against the applicant/accused about he assaulted on victim by kicks and fists only, therefore, considering role played by applicant/accused, he be released on bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4. On the other hand, learned APP submitted that present applicant/accused along with other co­accused, formed unlawful assembly and in prosecution of common object of said assembly,assaulted victim with deadly weapon, with intent to commit his murder. He further submitted that at this stage, role of the applicant/accused cannot be separated. He further submitted that blood stains clothes is seized from applicant/accused, which shows his involvement in the alleged commission of offence, therefore, his bail application be rejected. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5. On perusing police papers, prima facie, it reveals that at about 6­16 a.m. on the basis of report lodged by injured Vishal Amrale, a Crime No.346/2018 came to be registered at Bibwewadi Police Station against present applicant/accused and other co­ accused. Moreover, in the FIR, it is alleged that on the count of previous quarrel, present applicant/accused and other co­accused have assaulted on victim. Moreover, in the FIR, it is alleged co­ accused­Ritesh and Aniket have assaulted on victim with sickle, and present applicant gave kicks and fists blow to victim. Moreover, it seems that Investigating officer has seized blood stains clothes of presnt applicant/accused. Injuryh certificate shows that on 15/12/2018, injured­Tushaar was admitted in Bharati Vidhyapeeth hospital with history of assault by unknown persons, and he has sustained injuries to his both hands and head etc. So far as role played by present applicant/accused is concerned, he gave only kicks and fist blows to the victim. Moreover, it appears that nothing is remained to be seized from the custody of the applicant/accused. Moreover, custodial interrogation of the applicant/accused is now not necessary. Therefore, considering all these aspects, in my view if present applicant­accused is released on bail on certain conditions, no prejudice will be caused to the prosecution.
