  "processedText": "Cri.Bail Application no. 127/19 CNR No. MHPU01-00496-2019 ORDER BELOW EXH.1 \r\n---header-ends---\r\n1] Perused application and say. Heard Advocate for applicant and APP for the State. 2] This is first bail application filed under section 439 of Cr.P.C. by applicant in respect of his arrest in C.R. no. 689/18 registered at Bharati Vidyapeeth Police Station for the offence punishable under section 363,376 of the Indian Penal Code and under section 4,8,12 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012.\r\n---background-ends---\r\nIt is alleged that father of victim aged about 17 years lodged report of her missing. During investigation and after recording statement of victim, it revealed that victim and applicant were acquainted with each other and there was friendship between them. On 26.12.2018 applicant told victim that he want to marry with her and they would run away. Then applicant took victim at Karjat at the house of his uncle and they both resided with his uncle and aunti. On 27.12.2018 applicant committed sexual intercourse with victim under pretext of marriage. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3] According to applicant he is falsely implicated in this matter. It is a case of love affair. Victim herself left the house. Victim is more than 16 years old and attended age of sufficient maturity. Applicant is 23 years old and doing labour work. He is only earning member of family. He is permanently residing at Katraj Kondhawa Road, Pune. He has no criminal antecedents. He is ready to abide the conditions. Hence, he prayed to release him on bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4] APP and I.O. objected this application on the ground that investigation is in progress. Statement of victim under section 164 of Cr.P.C. is yet not recorded. Applicant committed sexual intercourse with victim under pretext of marriage. Applicant will pressurize victim and witnesses. There is possibility of tampering prosecution evidence. So, they prayed to reject the application. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5] Allegations against the applicant are serious. Applicant is sufficiently interrogated. From statement of victim role attributed to applicant can be gathered. It revealed that due to friendship victim and applicant went away and resided at Karjat in the house of uncle of applicant. According to victim applicant promised to marry with her and committed sexual intercourse with her. Victim is 17 years old and applicant is 23 years old. Victim has attended age of sufficient maturity and knows the consequences of act. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6] In this context it is necessary to rely on authority cited in Sunil Mahadev Patil Vs. State of Maharashtra reported in 2016 All MR (Cri.) 1712, in which it is observed that if statement of prosecutrix and witnesses shows that they were in love relationship with each other they eloped and went to temple and performed marriage, they started residing together in the house of relative then there are mitigating circumstances. Moreover, it is observed that factor i.e. age of prosecutrix, whether act is violent, whether there are antecedents or not, whether offender is capable of repeating the act or not, whether there is likelihood of threats or intimidation if at all the boy is released, whether chance of tampering with material witnesses and age of the applicant and his employment and plan, stabilize and secure his future are to be taken into consideration while deciding bail application, when boy and minor girl are in love with each other. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n7] Ratio laid down in above cited ruling is noted. In medical report victim gave history of love affair and sexual intercourse with consent. There are no injuries on her body. Victim never complained since beginning. These are mitigating circumstances. Moreover, investigation is practically over. Personal custody of applicant is not required. He has no criminal antecedents. His family members are depending on him. He is permanently, residing at Katraj Kondhawa Road, Pune. No purpose would serve by keeping the applicant behind bar for unknown period. Due to all above reasons application deserves to be allowed with following order ­ \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER 1] The application is allowed. 2] The applicant Kailas Bansi Narote be released on executing P.R. bond of Rs.30,000/­ with one or two solvent sureties in the like amount. 3] The applicant shall not tamper the prosecution witnesses in any manner. 4] The applicant shall attend Bharati Vidyapeeth Police Station on every Monday between 11.00 a.m. to 2.00 p.m. till the charge­sheet is filed. 5] The applicant shall not harass, threat and pressurize the victim. 6] The applicant shall co­operate investigating machinery as and when required. 7] Prior to furnishing surety, the applicant shall submit his address proof, mobile number and inform about the change in address and mobile number. \r\n---order-ends---\r\nPune.
