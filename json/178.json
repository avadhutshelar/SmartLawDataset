Co­accused Manoj assaulted him by means of sickle while other two unknown persons assaulted by means of iron rods. His FIR was recorded when the informant was taking treatment at Aastha Hospital. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6] Ld. advocate for the applicant has submitted that his name has not been mentioned in the FIR. He has been falsely implicated. The principal offender i.e. co­accused Manoj has been granted regular bail by this court. Custodial interrogation of the applicant is not necessary. He, therefore, prayed for bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n7] It is true that name of the applicant is not mentioned in the FIR. It is specifically mentioned that co­ accused Manoj along with two unknown persons obstructed his car, he said two unknown persons assaulted him by means of rod.

While granting regular bail to the co­accused­Manoj in para no.8 it has been observed that the informant sustained grievous as well as simple injuries. Therefore, prima­facie offence under section 326 of IPC is made out. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n8] The remand reports show that the weapons of the offence i.e. iron rods are yet to be seized. In such circumstances, custodial interrogation of the applicant is very much necessary. The applicant is, therefore, not entitled for anticipatory bail. 9] In view of the language of section­438 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, as the applicant is not entitled for anticipatory bail, there is no question of grant of interim anticipatory bail. Hence, following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nO R D E R Application is rejected. \r\n---order-ends---\r\n( A.N.Sirsikar ) Dt. : 16/01/2019. Additional Sessions Judge, Pune.
