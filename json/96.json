  "processedText": "Cri. Bail Appl. No. 113/2019 (CNR No. : MHPU01­000447­2019) Sonu Reddy Vs. State of Maharashtra \r\n---header-ends---\r\nORDER BELOW EXH. 1 1] This is an application filed by Sonu Anjeniya Reddy for regular bail under Section 439 of Code of Criminal Procedure in respect of Crime No. 299/2018 registered under Section 302 and 498­A read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code at Police Station, Vishrantwadi, Pune. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2] The offence came to be registered on report of Karbasappa Hanmantray Malli. He alleged that on 30/04/2017 marriage of his daughter Kavita had taken place with Chetan Reddy. He had paid dowry amount of Rs. 4,00,000/­, Gold ornaments were gifted in the marriage. After marriage, in­laws of Kavita used to ill­ treat her for not paying sufficient dowry. Victim Kavita used to narrate about the same to him. On 11/08/2018 when he visited to Pune, that time also Kavita narrated him about ill­treatment by all accused including present applicant who is brother­in­law of victim Kavita. On 22/09/2018 he came to know that, victim Kavita was pregnant of three months. On 28/09/2018 he called to Kavita, inquired about her health, but that time he heard abuse by mother­ in­law of Kavita. On the day of incident at about 07.00 pm., he came to know about death of Kavita. Therefore, he visited Sasoon Hospital and noticed there were injury marks on throat and cheek of Kavita. Hence, he approached to police and lodged the report. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3] Applicant submits that, now police have completed investigation and filed charge­sheet in the matter. Therefore, further custody of the Applicant is not necessary. The role attributed to him and co­accused Pinki is identical. This court has granted bail to co­ accused Pinki. Therefore, on the basis of parity, he is entitled for bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4] Applicant further submits that, the allegations about cruelty are vague and general in nature. Exactly what type of ill­ treatment was there and how present Applicant ill­treated victim, is a question. Even after completion of investigation, nothing material has been brought on record. Applicant is without any criminal antecedents. Therefore, he prays for grant of bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5] Learned APP Mr. Satpute appeared for Respondent/State and filed report of investigation officer. He submits that, prima facie informant has clearly stated about involvement of present Applicant in the crime. There are chances of tampering. Role of Applicant and co­accused Pinki is different. Moreover, Applicant was present at the spot at the time of incident. As per doctor, there were signs of homicidal death on body of victim. Offence is serious in nature. Therefore, he prays for rejection of the application. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6] Heard the learned Adv Mr. P. D. Durge for Applicant and the learned APP Mr. Satpute for Respondent/State. Perused the papers. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n7] While considering the bail application of co­accused Pinki, this Court clearly noted that, co­accused Pinki is a married lady and used to reside at her matrimonial house. Therefore, her bail application was allowed. But, present Applicant is brother ­in ­law of victim and was very much present at the scene of offence when the alleged incident had taken place. As per the postmortem report, doctors have observed in all 16 external injuries on body of deceased and all injuries are shown to be antemortem in nature. The cause of death has been observed as “Death due to asphyxia due to manual strangulation” (homicidal assault). Viscera is preserved. Presence of the Applicant is prima facie shown at the time of incident, and the signs of homicidal death of victim are also prima facie pointed out. Therefore, firstly rule of parity would not attract in favour of Applicant. Prima facie, victim was last seen with the Applicant and co­accused. Victim is shown to be in custody of Applicant and co­ accused. As such, prima facie, involvement of Applicant is made out, offence is serious in nature and chances of tampering are there, discretion cannot be used in favour of Applicant. Hence, I prefer to pass following Order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER 1] The application is rejected. \r\n---order-ends---\r\nsd/­xxx Pune. (Smt. A. V. Rotte) Date : 24/01/2019.
