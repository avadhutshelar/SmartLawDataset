  "processedText": "Cri.Bail Application no. 132/19 CNR No. MHPU01-000495-2019 ORDER BELOW EXH.1 \r\n---header-ends---\r\n1] Perused application and say. Heard Advocate for applicant and APP for the State. 2] This is first bail application filed under section 439 of Cr.P.C. by applicant in respect of his arrest in C.R. no. 217/18 registered at Marketyard Police Station for the offence punishable under section 363,366A,376(2)(i) of the Indian Penal Code and under section 3,4 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. \r\n---background-ends---\r\nIt is alleged that mother of victim aged about 16 years lodged report of her missing and against applicant. During investigation and after recording statement of victim, it revealed that victim and applicant were acquainted with each other. There was love affair between them. They were meeting each other and talking with each other. Applicant promised to marry with her. On 07.12.2018 mother of victim doubted on her and she gave evasive answers to her. She then narrated incident to applicant and applicant asked her to run away with him for marrying. They went to Pandhari, TalÂ­Ashti and then returned to Bhigwan, Pune. Then they started residing in room of Mahesh Nikam where applicant committed sexual intercourse with her. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3] According to applicant he is falsely implicated in this matter. It is a case of love affair. Victim is more than 16 years old. Applicant never forced her. She resided with applicant for one month. Investigation is practically over. Applicant is 20 years old and doing job . He is permanently residing at Ashti, DistÂ­Ahmednagar. He has no criminal antecedents. He is ready to abide the conditions. Hence, he prayed to release him on bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4] APP and I.O. objected this application on the ground that investigation is in progress. Applicant will pressurize victim and witnesses. There is possibility of tampering prosecution evidence. Victim is 15 years 10 months old and she was kidnapped and induced by applicant. Applicant will repeat offence. So, they prayed to reject the application. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5] Allegations against the applicant are serious. Applicant is sufficiently interrogated. From statement of victim role attributed to applicant can be gathered. It revealed that due to love affair victim and applicant went away at Pandhari, TalÂ­Ashti, DistÂ­Beed and Bhigwan, Pune, resided in a room of Mahesh Nikam. Victim is about 16 years old and applicant is 20 years old . Victim has attended age of sufficient maturity and knows the consequences of the act. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6] In this context Advocate of accused relied on authority cited in Sunil Mahadev Patil Vs. State of Maharashtra reported in 2016 All MR (Cri.) 1712, in which it is observed that if statement of prosecutrix and witnesses shows that they were in love relationship with each other they eloped and went to temple and performed marriage, they started residing together in the house of relative then there are mitigating circumstances. Moreover, it is observed that factor i.e. age of prosecutrix, whether act is violent, whether there are antecedents or not, whether offender is capable of repeating the act or not, whether there is likelihood of threats or intimidation if at all the boy is released, whether chance of tampering with material witnesses and age of the applicant and his employment and plan, stabilize and secure his future are to be taken into consideration while deciding bail application, when boy and minor girl are in love with each other. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n7] Ratio laid down in above cited ruling is noted. It appears that since beginning and while residing with applicant, victim never complained . Only when her mother doubted on them she gave evasive answers and went with applicant by narrating said fact. These are mitigating circumstances. Moreover, investigation is practically over. Personal custody of applicant is not required. Applicant is 20 years old and doing job. He is resident of TalÂ­ Ashti, DistÂ­Ahmednagar. He has no criminal antecedents. No purpose would serve by keeping the applicant behind bar for unknown period. Due to all above reasons application deserves to be allowed with following order Â­ \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER 1] The application is allowed. 2] The applicant Pravin Balu Shelke be released on executing P.R. bond of Rs.30,000/Â­ with one or two solvent sureties in the like amount. 3] The applicant shall not tamper the prosecution witnesses in any manner. 4] The applicant shall attend Marketyard Police Station on every Monday between 11.00 a.m. to 2.00 p.m. till the chargeÂ­sheet is filed. 5] The applicant shall not meet, harass, threat and pressurize the victim and shall not repeat the offence. 6] The applicant shall coÂ­operate investigating machinery as and when required. 7] Prior to furnishing surety, the applicant shall submit his address proof, mobile number and inform about the change in address and mobile number. \r\n---order-ends---\r\nPune.
