State of Maharashtra \r\n---header-ends---\r\nORDER BELOW EXH. 1 1] This is an application by Chetan Rajendra Barate for regular bail under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in respect of Crime No.454/2018 registered under Sections 313, 498­A, 494, 417, 323, 504, 506 read with Section 34 of Indian Penal Code at Police Station Khadak, Pune. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2] The crime has been registered on report of Sneha Barate. She alleged that, she knows Applicant as he helped her in performing love marriage with Santosh Bhavsar. However, after marriage with Bhavsar, she came to know that, he is criminal minded. Therefore, in 2010 she obtained divorce. But during that period, there was friendship between Applicant and her. Applicant assured her for marriage. Therefore, she started residing with him like his wife. She alleged that, in the year 2014, as there was no marriage between Applicant and her, the first abortion was taken place due to insistence of Applicant. In 2016 she married with Applicant. She again got pregnant, but Applicant made her to abort. She alleged that, Applicant used to ill­treat her by abusing, threatening and beating. Thereafter, Applicant made her to reside with her parents at Shukrawar Peth, Pune and started avoiding her. Thereafter, she came to know that, Applicant has performed marriage with co­accused Snehal and concealed this fact from her. As such, she lodged report against Applicant and co­accused. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3] Applicant submits that, police arrested him on 03/01/2019. Investigation is over. Therefore, his further custody is not necessary. He submits that, the allegations are baseless as Informant was already married and not capable to perform marriage with Applicant legally. She is alleging the incidents of abortions of year 2014 and 2016. But the FIR has been lodged in 2018, therefore, there is delay. So far as, allegations of bigamy are concern, those are subject matter of trial. But custody of the Applicant is not necessary. Hence, he prays for grant of bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4] The learned APP Mr. Satpute appeared for Respondent / State and filed report of investigation officer. He submits that, offence is serious in nature. Applicant has cheated Informant. There are chances of tampering. Therefore, the application may be rejected. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5] Heard learned Adv. S. T. Zalte for Applicants, learned APP Mr. Satpute for the State. Perused the FIR and Papers. 6] As per FIR, prima facie, the first abortion had taken place in the year 2014 and the second abortion had taken place in the year 2016. But that time, Informant did not allege about forceful abortion. Applicant is behind the bars since 03/01/2019 and investigation with the Applicant is almost over. Allegations are subject matter of trial, but further detention of the Applicant will serve no purpose. If strict conditions are imposed, the purpose of investigation machinery will be served. Hence, I prefer to pass following Order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER 1] The application is allowed. 2] The applicant, namely, Chetan Rajendra Barate be released on bail on executing P.R. bond of Rs. 25,000/­ (Rupees Twenty Five Thousand Only) with one or more solvent sureties of the like amount in Crime No. 454/2018 registered under Sections 313, 498­A, 494, 417, 323, 504, 506 read with Section 34 of Indian Penal Code at Police Station Khadak, Pune on the following terms and conditions.
