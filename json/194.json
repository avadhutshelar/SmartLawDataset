Moreover it seems that statement of all relevant witnesses are already recorded by Investigating officer.

Therefore, in my view by imposing some conditions i.e. attending the Police Station and to cooperate the Investigating Officer in the investigation, if the present applicant­ accused is released on anticipatory bail, no prejudice will be caused to the prosecution. Hence, application deserves to be allowed. Therefore, I pass the following order.",

  "processedText": "CNR No.MHPUO1­000939­2019 Mr. Tushar Ramdas Pardeshi Vs. The State of Maharashtra ( Dighi Police Station) \r\n---header-ends---\r\nOrder below Exh.1 in Cri. Bail Application No. 269/2019 1. The applicant­ accused has filed present application for anticipatory bail u/s.438 of Cr.P.C. in connection with C.R. No.378/2018 registered with Dighi Police Station for the offences punishable u/s. 279, 332, 353 of the Indian Penal Code and u/s. 132(1) (c), 119/177 of the Motor Vehicles Act. 2. Prosecution case is that on 29/12/2018 in between 3.20 p.m. to 3.30 p.m., Police constable­ Shri. Ravindra Sarmahale was on duty at Dehuphata chowky Alandi, and he was controlling traffic, at that time, applicant/accused came with four wheeler in high speed, rash and negligent manner, gave dash to Police constable­ Shri. Ravindra Sarmahale and fled away from the spot of incident. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n3. Learned counsel for applicant/accused submitted that applicant/accused has not committed any offence and he has been falsely implicated in this offence. He further submitted that at the relevant time of incident, applicant/accused was carrying his son, who was suffering from illness, for medical treatment. He further submitted that there is no antecedent against applicant/accused, therefore, he be released on anticipatory bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4. On the other hand, learned APP submitted that at the relevant time of incident, applicant/accused after giving dash to Police constable­ Shri. Ravindra Sarmahale fled away from the spot of incident and thereby obstructed police personnel while discharging duty. He further submitted that if applicant ­accused is released on 2 anticipatory bail, there is possibility of tampering the prosecution evidence. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5. On perusing police papers, it reveals that on the basis of statement dated 30//12/2018, offence bearing crime No.378/2018 came to be registered against applicant/accused. Moreover, in the complaint, it is alleged that on 29/12/2018, Police constable­ Shri. Ravindra Sarmahale was controlling traffic at Dehu phata chowky, at that time Car bearing registration No.MH/18/BC/1147 came in high speed, rash and negligent manner, gave dash to the complainant, and fled away towards Pune side. It appears that injured­ Police constable­ Shri. Ravindra Sarmahale is now discharged from the hospital. Moreover it seems that statement of all relevant witnesses are already recorded by Investigating officer. It appears that custodial interrogation of the present applicant/accused is now not necessary. Therefore, in my view by imposing some conditions i.e. attending the Police Station and to cooperate the Investigating Officer in the investigation, if the present applicant­ accused is released on anticipatory bail, no prejudice will be caused to the prosecution. Hence, application deserves to be allowed. Therefore, I pass the following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER i. Application is allowed. ii. In the event of arrest of applicant­ accused­ Tushar Ramdas Pardeshi , he be released on anticipatory bail on furnishing P.R. Bond in a sum of Rs.25,000/­ (Rs. Twenty five thousand only), with one or two solvent sureties in the like amount. iii. The applicant­ accused shall attend concerned Police Station on every Monday between 11 a.m. to 2 p.m and also as and when 3 required by the Investigating Officer and shall co­operate with the Investigation Agency till filing of charge sheet. iv. The applicant­ accused shall not tamper with prosecution evidence. v. The applicant­ accused shall not leave India without permission of the Court. \r\n---order-ends---\r\nDate :28/01/2019 (K.D.Vadane) Additional Sessions Judge, Pune. 4 “I affirm that the contents of the PDF file order are same word to word as per original judgment.” Name of Steno : Shri S.
