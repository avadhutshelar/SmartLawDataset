  "processedText": "Bail Appln.No. 177/2019 CNR-MHPU01-000692-2019 \r\n---header-ends---\r\nORDER BELOW EXH. 1 1. This is an application under Sec. 439 of Cr.P.C. for grant of bail pending trial. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2. Informant Manali Zagade had lodged report with Talegaon Dabhade Police Station by alleging that on 12.12.2018 at around 6.30 p.m. her husband was returning home from work, at that time some persons who were sitting in front of Ramnath Waringe\u0027s house left the dog on his person. Thereafter, informant and her husband went where the said persons were sitting and there was altercation of words between informant and the persons sitting there. The informant and her husband when returned home, they saw Pravin Bhamre and his brother and one person coming behind to their house and abused them. Guruprasad Waringe, who resides it the informant\u0027s colony abused informant and her husband and gave fist blows with his friends to the informant. Thereafter, informant, her husband and some members of the colony reported the said matter to the police station. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3. The informant further alleged that on 13.12.2018 the meeting was organized in the society where around 15 to 20 members of the society were present. Ramnath Waringe i.e. present applicant accused calld Ramnath Kakde and inquired, whether police are present for the meeting. Guruprasad Waringe was also present inside the hall for the said meeting. There was sudden noise outside the hall on which informant and all members went outside and they saw Guruprasad Waringe, Pravin Bhamre and his brother, Nikhil Mane and other 2-3 persons assaulted Vilas Mhase with sickle and sword. Thereafter, said persons fled away on their vehicles. On the basis of the report lodged by the informant offence has been registered vide C.R.No. 703/2018 under Sec. 307, 120-B, 143, 144, 147, 148, 149, 504, 506 34 of I.P.C., 135 of Mumbai Police Act and 4, 25, 27 of Arms Act with Talegaon Dabhade Police Station. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4. By this application applicant contends that he has not committed any offence. He has been falsely implicated in the said crime. Informant and applicant\u0027s father are members of the same society. Many times applicant\u0027s father has taken objection in the meeting, due to that reason informant has falsely implicated him and his father in the present crime. Applicant is not concern with the assailants and not directly or indirectly involved in the alleged crime. Practically investigation has been completed. Nothing has been discovered or recovered at the instance of the applicant. Co-accused has been released on anticipatory bail. He is permanent resident and possessing landed property. Applicant is ready to co-operate with the further investigation and ready to abide the terms and conditions imposed by the court. Thus, applicant prayed for anticipatory bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5. In response to the show cause notice prosecution has filed its say vide Exh. 3 thereby denied all adverse allegations and reiterated its case. It is contended that applicant will pressurize the informant and witnesses. Applicant, complainant and injured witnesses are residents of same society therefore, there is possibility of commission of serious offence. Charge-sheet has been filed. Thus, prosecution has prayed for rejection of application. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6. Heard Ld.Counsel for the applicant and Ld.A.P.P. for the State. Prima facie there is sufficient material on record to show involvement of the accused in the alleged offence. But provided punishment to an offence punishable under Sec. 307 of I.P.C. is not exclusively punishable with life imprisonment. It further appears that informant injured is already discharged from the hospital. After perusal of injury certificate it appears that there is no chance of converting the offence into grave one. It further appears that applicant is behind bar from 14.12.2018. He appears to be a young boy aged about 23 yrs. and carrying dairy and hotel business. The charge-sheet is already filed by the prosecution on 29.01.2019. Accused is ready to abide the conditions if any imposed by this court. Main purpose of granting bail is to secure presence of accused to face the trial. Accused appears to be permanent resident of Pune, having roots in the society, therefore, question of his fleeing from justice does not arise. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n7. Bail is the rule and jail is exception. No useful purpose will suffice by keeping him behind bar. Therefore, I am of the opinion that applicant is entitled for bail on furnishing heavy surety and stringent conditions. Thus, following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nO R D E R 1. Application No. 177/2019 is hereby allowed. 2. Applicant Guruprasad Ramnath Waringe in C.R.No. 703/2018 registered with Talegaon Dabhade Police Station be released on bail on furnishing P.R.Bond of Rs. 20,000/- with one or two solvent sureties in like amount. 3. He shall attend the concerned police station whenever directed by the I.O. in writing and co- operate the investigating officer in further investigation. 4. He shall not directly or indirectly make any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of this case. 5. If the applicant committed breach of any conditions, the prosecution is at liberty to approach this court for cancellation of the bail. \r\n---order-ends---\r\n( S. H. Gwalani ) Dt. : 30.01.2019 Additional Sessions Judge, Pune."
