  "processedText": "Cri. Bail Appl. No. 213/2019 (CNR No. : MHPU01­000738­2019) Karan Aaher Vs. State of Maharashtra \r\n---header-ends---\r\nORDER BELOW EXH. 1 1] This is an application by Karan Arjun Aaher for regular bail under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in respect of Crime No. 318/2018 registered under Sections 498(A), 304(b), 306 read with Section 34 of Indian Penal Code at Police Station, Dighi, Pune. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2] The crime has been registered on report of Anusaya Babar who is grandmother of victim Sayali. She alleged that, marriage of Sayali had taken place with Applicant on 11/05/2018. Informant alleged that, after marriage, for two weeks Sayali was treated well and then she was subjected to cruelty. It is alleged that, father­in­law of Sayli used to give her cold drink by mixing liquor and ravished her by touching her body. Other accused also used to subject her to cruelty for household reasons and demand of money. On 19/11/2018 Sayali was at her parental house. Co­accused denied for taking back her in their house. Therefore, Sayali committed suicide at parental house by hanging herself. Hence, the report has been lodged. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3] Applicant submits that, police arrested him on 21/11/2018. Investigation is almost over. He never subjected his wife to cruelty, nor abetted her to commit suicide. Prima facie, the incident had taken place at parental house of victim. Therefore, there is no question of abettement by present Applicant. No specific role is attributed to him. He is not going to flee away. He does not have any criminal antecedents. Therefore, he prays for grant of bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4] Learned APP Mr.Satpute appeared for Respondent/State and filed report of investigation officer. He submits that, firstly, present Applicant demanded Rs.50,000/­ to purchase a two wheeler. Further, accused demanded Flat at Deccan and for which all accused subjected victim to cruelty. Ultimately, accused did not allow victim for cohabitation. Therefore, she committed suicide. Offence is serious in nature. There are chances of tampering. Therefore, he prays for rejection of the application. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5] Heard Adv. W. G. Maniyar for Applicant, learned APP Mr. Satpute for the State. Perused the FIR and Papers. 6] Prima facie, it is alleged against Applicant that, he being husband of victim subjected her to cruelty for demand of Rs.50,000/­ for purchase of a two wheeler, which was fulfilled. But again all accused demanded Flat at Deccan. However, prima facie, no specific date of these demand has been mentioned. Moreover, prima facie, the incident has occurred at parental house of victim. As per postmortem report, the cause of death is “Asphyxia due to hanging.” Therefore, the incident of suicide had taken place at parental house of victim. It would be question of trial whether Applicant intended victim to commit suicide or created such situation for her for committing suicide and what is the proximate link between the act of Applicant and the incident of suicide. For which trial is necessary, but further detention of the Applicant is not necessary. There are no criminal antecedents. Therefore, by putting suitable conditions on Applicant, purpose will be served. Hence, I prefer to pass the following Order.\r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER 1] The application is allowed. 2] The Applicant, namely, Karan Arjun Aaher be released on bail on executing P.R. bond of Rs. 25,000/­ (Rupees Twenty Five Thousand Only) with one or more solvent sureties of the like amount in Crime No.318/2018 registered under Sections 498(A), 304(b), 306 read with Section 34 of Indian Penal Code at Police Station, Dighi, Pune on the following terms and conditions. [i] Applicant to co­operate the investigating machinery fully. [ii] Applicant should not contact Informant and witnesses and should not tamper the evidence in the matter. [iii] Applicant to provide proof of his permanent address and contact details to the investigation officer. [iv] Applicant should not change the address and contact details without prior permission of the Court. [v] Applicant should not indulge into any crime. 3] Bail before the concern Court of Magistrate. 4] Intimate to the concern Police Station accordingly. \r\n---order-ends---\r\nsd/­xxx Pune. (Smt. A.
