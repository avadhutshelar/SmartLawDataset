By this application under Section 439 of Cr.P.C., applicant/ accused­ Ejaj Sattar Pathan of CR No. 19/2019 registered on 05.01.2019 with Wanwadi Police Station, Pune, under Sections 307, 120B, 143, 144, 147, 148, 149, 506(2) of Indian Penal Code, under Sections 3, 4 (25) of Arms Act, under Section 37(1)(3) r.w.s 135 of Bombay Police Act and under Section 7 of Criminal Law Amendment Act, seeks regular bail. It is objected over nature of offence and ongoing investigation. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n3. The learned Counsel for the applicant has submitted that the applicant has no role to play in commission of offence. However, since his brother is co­ accused, he is implicated. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4. On the contrary, learned AGP submitted that the role of the applicant is attributed from an FIR that he has facilitated his Arm and vehicle used in commission of offence, therefore, he deserves no bail.\r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5. On going through copy of FIR, it is conspicuous that the members of an unlawful assembly had fired at the car of the informant, who immediately rushed to police station and lodged an FIR. Though, the applicant is not named in FIR, the co­accused are. Further, it reveals that there was counter FIR against Gang of the informant, emanated from alleged Gang­war at midnight. Brother of the applicant is a history­sheeter and charge­sheeted under MCOCA Act. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6. Learned Counsel for the applicant has submitted that the applicant has no criminal antecedents and he is a businessman. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n7. Learned AGP has submitted that the Arm and vehicle of the applicant was used in commission of offence by the co­accused and they were recovered during investigation. Rest investigation is on. The possibility of tampering of witnesses by terrorizing them cannot be totally ruled out. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n8. On going through record, the role played by the accused / applicant in commission of offence by extending Arm and vehicle, is obvious. Since, the applicant is not -named, identification parade is being arranged by the prosecution, wherein truth could whispered. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6. In view of above, having regard to nature of offence (Gang­war), on going investigation, the possibility of tampering of witnesses as apprehended by learned AGP cannot be totally ruled out.
