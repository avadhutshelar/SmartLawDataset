  "processedText": "ORDER BELOW EXH. 1 IN CRI. MISC. APPLICATION No. 47/2019 (Abhijit Ashok Bhise Vs. State of Maharashtra) CNR : MHST01-000266-2019 \r\n---header-ends---\r\n1) Present application is filed by the applicant under section 438 of Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 apprehending his arrest as a result of complaint dated 17.01.2019 filed by Sagar Ashok Shende, suspecting applicant\u0027s involvement in the C.R.No. 54/2019 for the offence pun/u/S. 307, 364, 392, 397, 298, 452, 143, 147, 149, 427, 510, 323 and u/Sec. 3/25, 30 of Arms Act. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2) It is contended that, the contents of FIR are altogether false and filed with ulterior motive to harass the applicant, applicant is permanent resident on the given address and he is innocent. It is further contended that, he undertakes to make himself available for interrogation by police as and when required, hence, prayed for anticipatory bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3) The prosecution has filed its say at Exh.5 and resisted the application on the grounds that, applicant and his associates have damaged the car of informant and upon questioning, after some hot exchange of words there was assault on the informant and his brother and caused injuries to them. It is contended that, associates of applicant used rifle to threaten the informant and witness. It is contended that, there were 8 to 10 culprits, weapons and vehicles used in commission of crime are to be seized. Hence, prayed for rejection of the application. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4) Advocate for applicant argued that, applicant is innocent person, having no connection with alleged offence and he falsely involved by this complaint. It is further argued that,  applicant is reputed in society and if he is arrested his family will be spoiled. It is further contended that, present applicant himself has sustained serious injuries in the incident, however, police did not take cognizance of the same. Applicant has no criminal background, he will coÂ­operate with the investigation machinery and will abide every condition imposed by the Court. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5) Considering the submissions and documents it seems that, the crime is registered against applicant and his two brothers and father after assault on applicant, he was hospitalized in Satara Diagnostic Centre as he was sustained serious injuries. It also seems that, father of applicant and a brother are already arrested and they were sent in P.C.R. Hence, it can be inferred that sufficient part of investigation has been over. Though it is contended that, there were 8 to 10 unknown persons involved in the offence, but no sufficient material is on record to believe it at this stage. It also seems that, crime against the applicant and his family members is registered as counter blast, therefore, preÂ­arrest bail may be granted to the applicant till filing of the chargeÂ­sheet by prosecution in the application. Hence, the order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER 1) Application Exh. 1 is granted. 2) In the event of arrest of applicant Abhijit Ashok Bhise, he be released on preÂ­arrest bail, in respect of the complaint filed by Sagar Ashok Shende dated 17.01.2019 (C.R.No. 54/2019) on his furnishing personal bond of Rs. 25,000/Â­ (Rs. Twenty Five Thousand), with one or more surety/ies, till filing of chargeÂ­sheet on following terms \u0026 conditions : a) Applicant shall attend the concern police station thrice in a week on every Monday, Wednesday and Saturday in between 11:00 a.m. to 1.00 p.m. b) Applicant shall not directly or indirectly make any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the case so as to dissuade him from disclosing such facts to the court or to any Police Officer. c) Applicant shall make available himself and coÂ­operate for interrogation by Police Officer as and when required and shall coÂ­operate in the investigation of the present C.R. d) Applicant shall not tamper any of the documents connected to the present C.R. under investigation. e) Applicant shall also produce the documents called by the I.O. during the course of his investigation. f) Applicant shall not leave Satara City without prior permission of the I.O. \r\n---order-ends---\r\n(B.S.Wavre) Place : Satara Addl.
