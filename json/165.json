Respondent. \r\n---header-ends---\r\nORDER BELOW EXH.1 This is the first bail application filed by the applicants under Section 438 of the Criminal Procedure Code for anticipatory bail in C.R.No.1247/2018 registered by Wakad Police Station under Section 326, 323, 504 r/w 34 of the Indian Penal Code. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n[2] Perused the application and say given at Exh.6. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[3] Heard learned advocate Mr. Swami for the applicants and learned APP Mr. Aurangabadkar for the State. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[4] The learned advocate for the applicants / accused argued that the applicants are falsely implicated in the present crime. Even if the FIR is perused, the role attributed to the applicants / accused is assault by hands, which may attract the offence under section 323 of the IPC, which is bailable offence. However, as it is alleged that another co­accused inflicted blow of scythe, offence under section 326 of IPC is applied by police. He submitted that having regard to the role attributed to the applicants / accused, it is clear that there is no need of custodial interrogation of the applicants. The applicants / accused are of young age and if they are arrested and send in jail, they may come in association with known criminals which might adversely affect their life. He prayed for allowing the application. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[5] The learned APP opposed the application contending that the offence in question is serious in nature. The co­accused Shubham inflicted blow of scythe, but he candidly submitted that so far as present applicants / accused are concerned, it is not alleged that they used any weapon for committing any assault. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[6] I have carefully gone through the FIR and other investigation papers produced for my perusal. Having regard to the role attributed to the applicants in the present crime and the grounds by police for rejection of the application, I find that there is no need of custodial interrogation of the applicants / accused. Hence, I pass the following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER [1] The application is allowed. [2] The anticipatory bail is granted. In the event of arrest of applicant No.[1] Amol Vishnu Kasar and No.[2] Deepak Vishnu Kasar in C. R.No.1247/2018 registered by Wakad Police Station, under Section 326, 323, 504 r/w 34 of the Indian Penal Code, they be released on anticipatory bail, on their executing PR Bond of Rs.20,000/­ each, with one or two sureties of like amount, on following conditions :­ [A] The applicants shall not tamper with the prosecution evidence in any manner. [B] The applicants shall attend Wakad Police Station on each Thursday between 10 a.m. to 12 noon, for the period of three months. Cri.B.A.No. 209/19 3 CNR No.MHPU01­000774­2019 [C] The applicants shall co­operate the Investigating Officer during investigation and they shall remain present before I. O. as and when required for interrogation. [D] The applicants shall not leave the jurisdiction of this court, without prior permission of this court. [3] Inform concerned police station accordingly. \r\n---order-ends---\r\nPune, Dated/­25­01­2019 ( Aniruddha Y. Thatte ) Additional Sessions Judge, Pune.
