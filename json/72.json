Act. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2] It is the case of prosecution that, Sonya Bhalke gave party to his friends including complainant Pradip Palaskar on account of birth of his child on 25.9.2018 at 2.00 pm. At the relevant time, at some distance this applicant and Jaywant Chitalkar were taking drinks. Few days before that incident, this applicant was arrested by police in connection with theft of gold ornaments. Therefore, this applicant was having suspicion that complainant has given information / tip about his involvement to the police, therefore, he was having grudge against the complainant. Out of that grudge, on the day of that party, when complainant was taking meal, said Jaywant Chitalkar and this applicant came and sat behind him. Then, Jaywant caught hold complainant from behind and facilitated this applicant to make assault on him by means of Scythe with intention to commit his murder and thereby committed this offence. In that assault, he sustained serious injuries. Therefore, on the complaint of injured complainant, this offence is registered. Applicant was arrested on 30.09.2018. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3] Advocate of applicant in his argument has stated that there is inordinate delay of four hours in lodging the complaint. The injured himself confused whether assault was made on him by sickle or scythe. Therefore, in FIR and in supplementary statement he has given different versions about weapon used. Charge­sheet is already filed. Investigation is completed. Accused Jaywant Chitalkar is already released on bail. Injured is already discharged from the hospital and he is out of danger. The applicant is permanent resident of Pune. He is ready to abide the conditions. Hence, his application may be allowed. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4] Ld. DGP strongly opposed this application. It is her contention that mere filing of charge­sheet is not change in circumstance. The role of accused Jaywant was very limited and he was released on bail. This applicant is the main assailant. He had made assault by sharp edged weapon on vital part of the body of Complainant with intention to kill him. Hence, his case cannot be equated with accused Jaywant. Therefore, on the ground of parity, he is not entitled to be released on bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5] Investigation is already completed and charge­sheet has been filed by IO. Co­accused of this applicant is already released on bail. Nothing remained to be recovered or discovered from him. Injured is already discharged from the hospital. Weapon is recovered. This is case of 2019, for beginning and conclusion of trial sufficient time will require till then further detention of applicant is not necessary. Hence, I pass following order : \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER 1. Bail Application No.84/2019 is allowed. 2. Applicant­Nilesh Bhausaheb Kolape be released on bail in C.R. No.310/2018 registered with Chinchwad Police Station, Pune, under sections 307 r/w 34 of IPC, under section 4 (25) of Arms Act and 37 (1) /(135) of B.P. Act, on furnishing PR bond of Rs.25,000/­ (Rs.
