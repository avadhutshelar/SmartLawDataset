    "text": "This is an application for anticipatory bail as per section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Heard advocate Mr. Rupnawar for applicant. He submitted that Crime No.1140/2018 is registered against this applicant with Satara City Police Station for the offences punishable under sections 354, 506, 509 etc. of the Indian Penal Code. Applicant is having strong apprehension of his arrest in this crime. He is in police service and as such having reputation in the society. He is local resident. At present he is posted as Sepoy at District Prison, Satara. He has not committed any offence. False and concocted FIR has been lodged by the informant/prosecutrix. Allegations in the FIR are not attracting the provisions of section 354, but those are attracting the provisions of section 354(1) which is bailable offence. If applicant is arrested on the false accusation then he would have to loose his job and therefore he prayed that by imposing certain conditions, he may be released on anticipatory bail. There is nothing which is to be seized from him and as such his custodial interrogation is not at all required by the police. He is ready to obey with all the conditions those may be imposed upon him.",

  "processedText": "1/3 Criminal Misc. Application No. 8/2019 Shankar Shivaji Khuspe Vs. State of Maharashtra ORDER BELOW EXH.01 IN CRI. MISC. APPLN. NO. 8/2019 1. \r\n---header-ends---\r\nThis is an application for anticipatory bail as per section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Heard advocate Mr. Rupnawar for applicant. He submitted that Crime No.1140/2018 is registered against this applicant with Satara City Police Station for the offences punishable under sections 354, 506, 509 etc. of the Indian Penal Code. Applicant is having strong apprehension of his arrest in this crime. He is in police service and as such having reputation in the society. He is local resident. At present he is posted as Sepoy at District Prison, Satara. He has not committed any offence. False and concocted FIR has been lodged by the informant/prosecutrix. Allegations in the FIR are not attracting the provisions of section 354, but those are attracting the provisions of section 354(1) which is bailable offence. If applicant is arrested on the false accusation then he would have to loose his job and therefore he prayed that by imposing certain conditions, he may be released on anticipatory bail. There is nothing which is to be seized from him and as such his custodial interrogation is not at all required by the police. He is ready to obey with all the conditions those may be imposed upon him. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2. Notice was issued to the prosecution. APP Mrs. Diwakar by filing her say at Exh.5 strongly resisted the application. She submitted that at the relevant time at about 10.30 p.m., applicant unlawfully entered the house of informant under the influence of liquor and abused her in filthy language by using criminal force to her. Allegations in the FIR are too serious. The motorcycle which is used by this applicant in the commission of offence is yet to be seized. For the seizure of motorcycle and for overall investigation, custodial interrogation of this applicant is required by the police. If pre­arrest protection is granted to him then entire investigation would be paralyzed. Therefore, she submitted that considering the conduct and nature of this applicant, application may be rejected. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3. After going through the FIR lodged by the informant/ prosecutrix, it is seen that at the relevant time, this applicant unlawfully entered her house under the influence of liquor and abused her in very filthy language by using obscene words by raising his hands and by showing some signs. It is thus seen that criminal force has been used by him to her. When he saw that neighbours are coming on the spot of incident and upon hearing shouts of people, he fled away from the spot by riding on his motorcycle. He has sought sexual favours from the informant. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4. Though applicant is in police service as a Prison Sepoy with District Prison Satara, he by taking law in his own hands is 3/3 Criminal Misc. Application No. 8/2019 alleged to have committed serious offences. Considering the nature and seriousness of accusation and gravity of offences so also the conduct and behaviour of applicant, his custodial interrogation is required by the police. He has also given threats with life injury to the informant, her parents etc. It is seen that he has abused his position while committing such acts. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5. Investigation is at crucial stage. Motorcycle used by applicant in the commission offence is yet to be seized and for overall investigation, his presence with the police is certainly necessary. If pre­arrest protection is granted to him then entire investigation would be paralyzed and serious prejudice would be caused to the prosecution. As such he does not deserve for pre­ arrest protection. Application deserves to be rejected. Hence the order follows:­ \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER 1 Application is rejected. (Order is dictated and pronounced in the open Court) Satara \r\n---order-ends---\r\n(R.D.Deshpande) Dt.10/01/2019. Additional Sessions Judge, Satara."
