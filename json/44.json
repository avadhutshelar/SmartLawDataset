State of Maharashtra \u0026 Karnataka \r\n---header-ends---\r\nORDER BELOW EXH. 1 Applicant ­Sameer S/o. Vikram Trivedi has filed this application for grant of transitory anticipatory bail under Section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in connection with FIR case No. 25/2018 for the offences punishable u/s. 406, 420, 427 of I.P.C. registered at C.E.N., Police Station Belgavi City, Karnataka. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n[2] Heard the Ld. Counsel for the Applicant Shri. S.M. Bhalgat. Perused the documents filed with the application. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[3] The applicant is operating the business of tours and travels by name ‘ Satnam Tours and Travels’. Applicant took the buses from bus owners on rental basis and the said buses were plying on daily fix routes. The applicant came in contact with one Shri. Pradip Basawraj Telsang r/o. Karnataka, who also deals in Tours and Travels business. The said Pradip supplied the tourist buses to the applicant on Hire Purchase Agreement. The applicant has taken 10 luxury buses for his business from said Pradip during January – 2017 to March – 2017. Initially Applicant took 4 Volvo Buses after depositing Rs. 20 Lakhs. Thereafter, said Pradip put the proposal to applicant that he is having six A.C. sleeper coach bus of Tata motors and he is not interested to keep the buses with him for business purpose, as he has not having sufficient staff. After negotiation, applicant shown willingness to purchase the buses. The said buses are old and price was fixed at Rs. 83 Lakhs. The initial token amount of Rs. 12 Lakhs were transferred to said Pradip. After handing over the buses, said Pradip repeatedly asking for money to the applicant, but not interested to complete the formalities regarding the transfer and documentation of the said vehicle with transportation permit. RTO of Karnataka informed to the applicant that as buses are defective, the transfer will not be possible. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[4] The applicant filed complaint to Pune Commissioner Office against Pradip on 02.12.2017. The said Pradip appeared before Police on 09.12.2017 and the said dispute was sort out and applicant was ready for not to register a case against Pradip. Said Pradip also agreed that he will take his buses and entire transaction will be cancelled and monitory transaction will be cleared. Recently, a team of certain Karnatak police officer and local police officer visited to the office of Applicant for arrest o 26.12.2018. At the relevant time, applicant was out of station, therefore, police officer hand over the copy of notice u/s. 41A of Cr.P.C. to Manager of Satnam Tours and Travels and repeatedly contacting the applicant on phone to visit at Belgavi Police Station, Karnatak. Thus, the applicant apprehend that he might be arrested in the said crime on the political pressure of said Pradip. He prayed that, the transitory anticipatory bail be granted to him for limited period, so that he can approach at Session Judge of Belgavi, Karnataka. Hence, this application. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[5] He relied on the following case laws :­ (i) Sanjeev Chandel V. State of H.P. and another, 2003 CRI.L.J. 935. (ii) Neela J. Shah V. State of Gujarat and another, 1998 CRI. L.J. 2228. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[6] The Hon’ble Gujarat High Court in Neela J. Shah case held that, ‘’ The Court of Sessions of the High Court within whose jurisdiction one ordinarily resides, may apply for anticipatory bail and the same may be entertained by the said Court only with a view to provide an immediate relief so as to enable him to approach the court of Session or the High Court within whose territorial jurisdiction the offence alleged to have been committed. Thus an application u/s. 438 of Cr.P.C. should be finally decided only by the Court, whose territorial jurisdiction of the alleged offence has been committed. The Court entertaining application for anticipatory bail at the first instance, which does not have territorial jurisdiction can give protection only for a brief period on adequate condition with a view to enable person apprehending arrest to approach the Court within whose territorial jurisdiction the offence alleged to have been committed.\r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[7] After considering the factual aspect, there is apprehension in the mind of applicant that he may be arrested in the crime registered at Belgavi, Karnataka. Under the facts and circumstances as mentioned above, there is no hurdle to grant transitory anticipatory bail to the applicant. Hence, I proceed to pass the following order :­ \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER 1] In the event of arrest of the applicant – Sameer S/o. Vikram Trivedi by the police in FIR Case No. 25/2018 for the offences punishable u/s. 406, 420, 427 of I.P.C. registered at C.E.N., Police Station Belgavi City, Karnataka, during the period of 15 days from today, he shall be released on bail on his furnishing P.R. Bond of Rs.15,000/­ alongwith solvent surety of like amount. 2] It is, however, clarified that, this order shall remain operative only for 15 days from today i.e. up to 18th January, 2019, then it will be treated as automatically vacated and cancelled. 3] In terms of above order, the application is disposed of. \r\n---order-ends---\r\nSd/­ Pune ( G.P.Agrawal ) Date : 03/01/2019 Additional Sessions Judge, Pune. : 5 : CERTIFICATE I affirm that the contents of this P.D.F. file order are same word to word as per original order.
