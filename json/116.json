So also accused broke the glasses of the informant\u0027s Maruti Suzuki, Celero car and have caused damage to the tune of Rs. 7,00,000/-. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3. According to applicants they have been falsely implicated with ulterior motive. Their names are not appearing in the F.I.R. Relative of the co-accused have filed F.I.R. under Sec. 307 of I.P.C. in C.R.No. 842/2018 on 03.11.2018 and therefore to counter blast the said F.I.R. is lodged against accused with false and frivolous allegations. Present offence was registered on 04.11.2018 and there is unreasonable and unexplained delay of one day for lodging F.I.R. There are no criminal antecedents against the applicants. The investigation of the crime has been completed practically. The applicants are only earning persons of their family. They are permanent residents of Uralikanchan.

There is every possibility of dispute between accused and complainant and commission of body offence cannot be ruled out. Applicants will pressurize the informant and witnesses. Offence is serious. Investigation is in progress. Thus, prosecution prayed for rejection of the application. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5. Heard Ld.Counsel for the applicants and Ld.A.P.P. for the State. Perused case diary. It appears that as per the story of the prosecution that at around 3.00 p.m while availing the treatment to Dharmendra Tilekar (informant of C.R.No. 842/2018) the brother-in- law of Varsha Kadbane (i.e. informant in present C.R.No. 844/2018) received an unknown call informing him that some unknown persons have burned the house of informant and immediately the informant, father-in-law and other family members immediately rushed to their house and saw that accused along with around 20 -25 persons with mask were present and after seeing the informant and her family members they all ran away from the spot. In short, there grounds for believing that accusation is well founded against the accused. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6. It further appears that on the basis of the report lodged by Dharmendra Tilekar, C.R.NO. 842/2018 has been registered against Arjun, Nilesh, Sangita, Rahul, Hemant, Deepak, Kantabai, Varsha i.e. against the Kadbane family.

Main purpose of bail is to secure the presence of accused to face the trial.

No useful purpose will suffice by keeping them behind bars till filing of charge- sheet. Furthermore, the accused in C.R.No. 842/2018 under Sec. 307 of I.P.C. F.I.R. lodged by Dharmendra and he is already released on bail. Therefore, applicants can be released on bail with heavy conditions. Thus, following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nO R D E R 1.
