  "processedText": "Criminal Bail Application No.129/2019 CNR NO. MHPU01­000520­2019 Avdhoot Sunil Dedge …. Applicant. Vs. State of Maharashtra …. Respondent. \r\n---header-ends---\r\nORDER BELOW EXH.1 This is the first bail application under Section 439 of the Criminal Procedure Code by accused Avdhoot Sunil Dedge, in connection with C. R. No.3/2019 registered by Warje Malwadi police station, for the offence punishable under section 353, 323, 504 of the Indian Penal Code and under Section 119, 177, 179 of the Motor Vehicles Act. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n[2] Perused the say given by respondent at Exh.4. Heard learned advocate Mr. Lengare for the applicant / accused and APP Mr. Aurangabadkar for the State. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[3] The learned advocate for the accused / applicant argued that the accused in the present case is falsely implicated in the present crime, as there was exchange of words in a heat of moment. He further submitted that accused / applicant is law abiding citizen. He is ready to comply the conditions imposed. There is no likelihood of his getting absconded and since the witnesses are police officers, there is no question of tampering with the prosecution witnesses. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[4] The learned APP argued that the offence in question is serious in nature. The accused has taken law in his hand and assaulted the public servant in discharge of his official duty. He submitted that there is possibility of tampering with the prosecution evidence and repetition of the offence. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[5] I have gone through the FIR and the investigation papers produced for my perusal. It is alleged that when the informant Police Head Constable Manisha Londhe was discharging duty as public servant at Ambedkar square, the accused crossed the zebra crossing and when the informant was inquiring with him, applicant / accused assaulted her. Having regard to the nature of the crime, the role attributed to the accused / applicant, the age of the applicant and the period for which he is behind bar, I find that no further purpose would be served by keeping accused / applicant behind bar. So far as apprehension expressed by the prosecution that the applicant / accused may tamper with the prosecution evidence, that possibility is very less as the informant is the police head constable. Considering the material on record, I pass the following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER [1] The application is allowed. [2] The applicant / accused Avdhoot Sunil Dedge is released on bail, on his executing PR Bond of Rs.20,000/­, with one or two sureties of like amount, in connection with C.R.No. 03/2019, registered by Warje­Malwadi police station, on following conditions :­ Cri.B.A.No.129/19 3 CNR No.MHPU01­000520­2019 [A] The applicant / accused shall not tamper with the prosecution evidence in any manner and shall not repeat the crime. [B] The applicant / accused shall attend the court regularly during trial. [3] Bail before concerned JMFC. \r\n---order-ends---\r\nPune, Dated/­11­01­2019 ( Aniruddha Y. Thatte ) Additional Sessions Judge, Pune. I affirm that the contents of the PDF file Judgment are same word for word as per original Judgment. Name of Steno :­ Shri. V. V.
