He argued that no­doubt, applicants / accused assisted or helped the informant in purchase of landed property, but they have never committed breach of trust and they never cheated the informant. By taking me through the various documents filed on record, which are the notarized agreement for sale and registered sale deeds regarding the purchase of the land and sale of the land by informant and also the documents regarding the purchase of the property by applicants, the learned advocate argued that the amount of Rs.27,00,000/­ which informant alleged to have given  to the applicant, is already utilized for purchase of 28 R. land from Gat No.380 of village Nandani. The said land informant subsequently sold by registered sale and has received consideration of Rs. 37,51,000/­. Subsequently, informant purchased 8.63 R. land from Gat No.829 of village Nimshirasgaon on 25.04.2014 and 4 R. land from same Gat number on 21.6.2014. Though the amount given in registered sale deed is less, the amount of consideration in all transaction was more and it was mentioned in notarized documents. Thus, out of Rs. 37,51,000/­, informant received from selling the land at Nandani, she invested Rs. 26,46,000/­ for purchase of another land from village Nimshirasgaon.

  "processedText": "Criminal Bail Application No.187/2019 CNR NO. MHPU01­000710­2019 Mrs. Madhavi S. Dongare another 1 …. Applicants. Vs. State of Maharashtra …. Respondent. \r\n---header-ends---\r\nORDER BELOW EXH.1 This is the first bail application filed by the applicant under Section 438 of the Criminal Procedure Code for anticipatory bail in C.R.No.827/2018 registered by Hinjewadi Police Station under Section 406, 420, 504, 506 r/w 34 of the Indian Penal Code. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n[2] Heard learned advocate Mr. Pise for the applicants and APP Mr. Aurangabadkar for the State. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[3] The learned advocate Mr. Pise for the applicants argued that the accused are implicated in the false crime. The informant is real mother of applicant no.1 and mother­in­law of applicant No.2. The applicant Nos. 1 and 2 are husband and wife. He argued that no­doubt, applicants / accused assisted or helped the informant in purchase of landed property, but they have never committed breach of trust and they never cheated the informant. By taking me through the various documents filed on record, which are the notarized agreement for sale and registered sale deeds regarding the purchase of the land and sale of the land by informant and also the documents regarding the purchase of the property by applicants, the learned advocate argued that the amount of Rs.27,00,000/­ which informant alleged to have given  to the applicant, is already utilized for purchase of 28 R. land from Gat No.380 of village Nandani. The said land informant subsequently sold by registered sale and has received consideration of Rs. 37,51,000/­. Subsequently, informant purchased 8.63 R. land from Gat No.829 of village Nimshirasgaon on 25.04.2014 and 4 R. land from same Gat number on 21.6.2014. Though the amount given in registered sale deed is less, the amount of consideration in all transaction was more and it was mentioned in notarized documents. Thus, out of Rs. 37,51,000/­, informant received from selling the land at Nandani, she invested Rs. 26,46,000/­ for purchase of another land from village Nimshirasgaon. Therefore, the allegations in the FIR are not correct. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[4] The learned advocate for the applicants further argued that the informant had filed a petition under D. V. Act making similar allegations against the accused / applicants and the interim application was rejected by the Judicial Magistrate First Class after considering all documentary evidence by order dated 02­04­2018 and till the date the informant has not preferred appeal challenging the said order and instead of filing appeal and exhausting civil remedy, now this false complaint is given to the police. He submitted that the transaction in question is civil in nature. All documents are available in the court proceedings which can be made available to the police. There is no need of custodial interrogation of the applicants / accused. They have no criminal antecedents and they are ready to abide conditions if imposed. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[5] The learned APP for the respondent argued that the offence in question is serious in nature. Why would a mother give complaint against her own daughter and son­in­law. The amount of informant was utilized by applicants / accused for their own benefits and they have committed criminal breach of trust. They have cheated elderly lady. The custodial interrogation of the applicants / accused is necessary. He prayed for rejection of the application. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[6] I have carefully gone through the documents produced by both sides for my perusal, including FIR. In the FIR, the informant alleged that she was cheated by accused by taking Rs.47,00,000/­ from her, whereas in the reply given by the police to the application, it is alleged that accused / applicants had committed misappropriation of Rs. 37,51,000/­, which informant received after sale of the land. Firstly, there is a difference in the amount. As per FIR, the amount is quoted to be Rs. 47,00,000/­, whereas as per the say of the investigating officer, the amount is Rs.37,51,000/­. It is also clear from the material on record that after sale of land from village Nandani, the informant had purchased land from village Nimshirasgaon from Gat No.829 for consideration of Rs.26,46,000/­. The learned JMFC in D. V. case filed by the informant has considered the rival contentions and was pleased to reject the prayer of the informant and while doing so, the learned JMFC has considered all the transactions between the parties. Under these circumstances, from the material on record, prima­facie the dispute in question appears to be civil in nature. The accused / applicants did not have any criminal antecedents. There is no need of custodial interrogation of the applicants / accused. Hence, I pass the following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER [1] The application is allowed. [2] The anticipatory bail is granted. In the event of arrest of applicant [1] Mrs. Madhavi Sachin Dongare and applicant No. [2] Mr. Sachin Maruti Dongare in C. R.No.827/2018 registered by Hinjawadi Police Station, under Section 406, 420, 504, 506 r/w 34 of the Indian Penal Code, they be released on anticipatory bail, on their executing PR Bond of Rs.30,000/­ each, with one or two sureties of like amount, on following conditions :­ [A] The applicants shall not tamper with the prosecution evidence in any manner. [B] The applicants shall co­operate the Investigating Officer during investigation and they shall remain present before I. O. as and when required for interrogation. [C] The applicants shall surrender their passport to Hinjawadi police station. They shall not leave jurisdiction of this court, i.e. Pune district for next three months without permission of the court. [3] Inform concerned police station accordingly. \r\n---order-ends---\r\nPune, Dated/­19­01­2019 ( Aniruddha Y. Thatte ) Additional Sessions Judge, Pune.
