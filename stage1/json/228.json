State of Maharashtra) MHST01­000219­2019 \r\n---header-ends---\r\n1) Present application is filed by applicants under section 438 of Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 apprehending their arrest under C.R. no. 42/2018, registered at Khandala police station, at the instance of Sachinkumar Kallappa Tavagad for alleged commission of offences punishable under sections 199, 200, 193, 420, 468, 406 \u0026 409 r/w. 149 of Indian Penal Code, 1860 and hence have approached Court seeking pre­arrest bail. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2) Advocate for applicants argued that, the applicants have not committed offence as alleged by them. It is contended that, applicant no. 1 Laxmi was legally wedded wife of late Kallappa and applicants Pravin and Shivprasad are Kallappa\u0027s son. Kallappa after his marriage resided with the applicants till his death. Allegations in the FIR are contended to be false and baseless and contended of the informant having no relation, at all with Kallappa. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3) It is further contended that, applicants are the only legal heirs of late Kallappa and in such circumstances have not executed any false affidavit. It is further contended that, in any circumstances the offence relates to documents and hence their custodial investigation is not necessary. It is further contended that, the documents can be seized from the revenue authority. In such circumstances, custodial investigation is not necessary. Accordingly, pre­arrest bail is contended. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4) Bail application is resisted by APP by filing say at Exh.5 on the grounds that, investigation transpired of the applicant Pravin having executed a false affidavit and submitted before revenue authority and used the same as genuine. It is further contended that, Investigation Officer has submitted his \u0027A\u0027 Summary report to the Ld. JMFC Court, Satara seeking therein the permission for registering the offence against accused NC final summary. APP accordingly contended that, in such circumstances, pre­arrest bail application itself becomes not maintainable. Accordingly, contended for rejection of present pre­arrest bail application. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5) Upon perusing FIR, hearing applicant\u0027s advocate and APP, it appears that, allegations against applicants are of having fabricated false affidavit and used it before the revenue authority as genuine. Perusal of documents submitted by the APP reveals that, vide letter dated 22/01/2019 bearing outward no. 145/2019, Assist. Police Inspector Hanmant Gaikwad has forwarded his NC final report dated 31/12/2018 to Ld. J.M.F.C. Court for acceptance. In such circumstances, it appears that, Investigation Officer does not find that the applicants/accused having committed any cognizable offence. Therefore, undisputedly present pre­arrest bail application is rendered futile and not maintainable. Hence, the following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER Criminal Bail Application no. 31/2019, is rejected. \r\n---order-ends---\r\n(Y. H. Ameta) Place : Satara Addl. Sessions Judge Date : 14th February, 2019. Satara"
