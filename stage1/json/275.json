State of Maharashtra) CNR : MHST01­000401­2019 \r\n---header-ends---\r\n1) Present application is filed by the applicant under section 439 of Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 seeking his release from arrest under C.R. no. 178/2018, registered at Mahabaleshwar police station, at the instance of Alka Subhash Shinde, for alleged commission of offence punishable under section 306 of Indian Penal Code, 1860. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2) Advocate for applicant\u0027s contended that, present accused is falsely implicated in the offence without having no concern with the death or suicide of the informant\u0027s son. It is also contended that, the informant\u0027s son Anil before committing the suicide had committed murder of his wife Seema, hence also the informant\u0027s narration in the FIR making allegations against this accused, are false. FIR no. 176/2018 is also registered at Mahabaleshwar police station against Anil, under section 302 of Indian Penal Code, 1860 for committing Seema\u0027s murder. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3) It is contended that, Anil was staying with his wife at Dhanori road, separately from the informant since last 5 years, therefore, it would be improbable for informant to be knowing of anything transpiring at Dhanori road. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4) It is also contended that, the informant\u0027s allegations of this accused frequently visiting Anil\u0027s house in his absence, giving gifts to Anil\u0027s wife Seema and also taking her out for food are false and unbelievable, even for the fact that same are to the informant\u0027s admission of being told by her relatives. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5) It is also contended that, allegations in the FIR against accused of behaving inappropriately with Seema while in car is also false, as the informant contends of it to have been told by her son Anil to her. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6) It is contended that, all the incidences and allegations made in FIR are based on the informant\u0027s hearsay knowledge. FIR is also product of false and frivolous allegations. Anil was found in injured condition in his room, but Anil\u0027s any statement or dying declaration is not recorded. The actual reasons of Anil\u0027s committing Seema\u0027s murder and committing suicide, does not gets revealed anywhere. Therefore, informant\u0027s FIR against this applicant is false. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n7) It is also contended that, the said suicide note allegedly found from Anil\u0027s purse is planted one. It is also contended that, alleged suicide note contains the name of two persons, however offence is registered against this accused only and there appears no action initiated against other persons named in the alleged suicide note. Accordingly, not only the FIR, but even investigation also biased against this accused. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n8) It is also contended that, even if Tangapan\u0027s relations with Seema, would be accepted, then also, it in no manner could be a factor abetting Anil\u0027s suicide. Accordingly, it is contended that, in no manner did the accused abet Anil\u0027s suicide. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n9) It is contended that, at no point of time, was the accused in relationship with Seema. Accused is of fatherly age to Seema, therefore in no circumstances would accused involved in such immoral act or illicit relations. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n10) It is also contended that, accused is arrested since 13/12/2018, investigation is completed, charge­sheet is filed, there is change in circumstances, accused is suffering from various ailments, hence is required to be released on bail, as trial may take its own time to conclude. Accordingly, bail is contended. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n11) Bail application is resisted by the APP by filing say at Exh. 7 on the grounds that, Anil had committed suicide by stabbing himself on 06/12/2018. Anil\u0027s suicide is abetted by the applicant/accused as this accused was in illicit relations with Anil\u0027s wife Seema. Before committing suicide, Anil had committed Seema\u0027s murder also. The suicide note found in Anil\u0027s purse specifically blamed this accused\u0027s for Seema\u0027s murder and Anil\u0027s suicide. The said suicide note mentioned this accused\u0027s physical relations with Seema. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n12) Accused was in illicit relationship with Seema, hence the matrimonial relations between Anil and Seema were disturbed. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n13) APP contended that, investigation is completed, charge­sheet is filed, however accused is resident of the State of Kerala, therefore, possibility of his absconding cannot be ruled out, apprehensions of pressurizing or influencing the witnesses or the informant, tampering of evidences, does not entitle bail to the accused. Accordingly, bail is resisted. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n14) Upon hearing the APP and applicant\u0027s advocate, perusing the papers it appears that, before committing suicide, Anil committed murder of his wife Seema. Investigation case is of accused maintaining illicit relations with Seema. It is the informant\u0027s allegation in FIR of Anil having seen accused indulging in inappropriate behaviour with Seema in the car. Anil is alleged to having disturbed because of relations between accused and Seema. It is the investigation agency\u0027s case that. Anil\u0027s this disturbance has led to Seema\u0027s murder and Anil\u0027s suicide. Accordingly, allegations of abatement of suicide against this accused. Investigation also transpires of suicide note found in Anil\u0027s purse. It also appears that, investigation is completed, charge­sheet is filed. Allegations are of abatement of suicide. Accused is of 65 years old man suffering from various ailments, requiring continuous medical treatments. It is uncertain as to the time to be consumed for trial to conclude. In such circumstances it appears that no much purpose will be served by keeping the accused arrested any further. However, APP\u0027s apprehensions are also required to be taken care of. Hence, the following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER 1) Criminal Bail Application no. 81/2019, is allowed. 2) Accused Tangapan Velayoudha Panikar, be released on bail, from arrest under C.R. no. 178/2018, registered at Mahabaleshwar police station, on his furnishing personal bond of Rs.50,000/­ (Rs. Fifty Thousand) with two solvent sureties, atleast one local, to make up the bond amounts, on following terms and conditions; a) Accused shall not tamper with any evidence. b) Accused shall not directly or indirectly make any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the case so as to dissuade him from disclosing such facts to the court or to any Police Officer. c) Accused shall make available himself and co­operate for interrogation by Police Officer as and when required. d) Any default of above conditions shall render the bail to be cancelled automatically. e) Compliance before lower Court. \r\n---order-ends---\r\n(Y.
