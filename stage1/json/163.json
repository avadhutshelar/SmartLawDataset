Prima facie there is sufficient material on record to show the involvement of the accused in the alleged offence, but provided punishment to an offence punishable with Sec. 307 of I.P.C. is not exclusively punishable with life imprisonment. It appears that accused is behind bar from 22.12.2018. It further appears that informant injured is already discharged from the hospital. There is no prospect of the offence being escalated to higher count.

The informant further alleged that on 19.12.2018 he was harvesting his jawar crop, it was lying on bandh. Housabai moved the lying jawar crop and informant told not to do it. Her grandson was irrigating corn crop situated nearby, Then he started to abuse informant, then informant also abused to him. Thereafter, accused Dilip Pokale called his father by phone call. Thereafter, Kashinath Pokale, Navnath Pokale, Sangita Pokale had been to the spot and abused to the informant. At that time Housabai came near to the informant and told not to make dispute as they are neighbourer and lien on his feet. Thereafter, informant told not to do so, at the relevant time accused Nathu and Dilip assaulted on his head by means of an axe and Kashinath, Navnath and Sangita beat him on backside by wood or stone. Thereafter, informant ran away towards village through canal. Thereafter, Pandurang Meche, Eknath Pokale brought informant in private hospital for primary treatment. Thereafter, informant and his father came to Shirur Police Station. Police referred him to P.H.C., Shirur and thereafter to Sassoon Hospital. Thereafter, again admitted in Vighnaharta Hospital, Shirur on 22.12.2018. On the basis of said report C.R.No. 982/2018 under Sec. 307, 324, 323, 143, 141, 147, 149, 504, 506 of I.P.C. came to be registered. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4. By this application applicant contends that incident took place on 21.12.2018 and complaint lodged on 22.12.2018, after thought. Thereafter, accused Nathu Pokale has lodged report vide C.R.No. 983/2018 against informant and his wife and family members under Sec. 452, 323, 504, 506 and 34 of I.P.C. Informant\u0027s father Pandurang Meche was in police service. Complainant is having criminal antecedents. Alleged axe has been recovered by the police. Nothing is to be remained to be seized. Practically investigation is over. There are no criminal antecedents against the applicant. Complainant is already discharged from the hospital. Applicant Dilip s suffering from epilepsy disorder and rheumatic heart disease. There is no nexus between the alleged offence and the applicant. Applicant is ready to abide the terms and conditions imposed by the court. Thus, applicant prayed for grant of bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5. In response to the show cause notice prosecution has filed its say vide Exh. 4 and interalia denied all adverse allegations and reiterated its case. It is contended that offence is serious. The informant and accused are residents of same village therefore, again they will commit similar offence. They will pressurize the informant and witnesses. On these lines prosecution prayed for grant of anticipatory bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6. Heard Ld.Counsel for the applicants and Ld.A.P.P. for the prosecution. Perused case papers. There are grounds for believing that information is well founded against the accused. It further appears that both parties lodged report against each other by making serious allegations against each other. Prima facie there is sufficient material on record to show the involvement of the accused in the alleged offence, but provided punishment to an offence punishable with Sec. 307 of I.P.C. is not exclusively punishable with life imprisonment. It appears that accused is behind bar from 22.12.2018. It further appears that informant injured is already discharged from the hospital. There is no prospect of the offence being escalated to higher count. Considering the involvement of the present accused in this crime I am of the opinion that his custodial interrogation is not required. He is ready to co-operate in the further investigation and also ready to abide conditions if any imposed by this court. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n7. Main purpose of granting bail is to secure the presence of the accused to face the trial. It further appears that accused is permanent resident of Tal. Shirur, Dist. Pune, having roots in the society, therefore, question of his fleeing from justice does not arise. Investigation appears to be almost completed pertaining to the present accused. No purpose will suffice by keeping him behind bar till filing of charge-sheet. Therefore, accused is entitled for bail. However, interest of the prosecution can be safeguarded by imposing certain conditions. Thus, following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nO R D E R 1. Application No. 207/2019 is hereby allowed. 2. Applicant Dilip @ Vithal Kashinath Pokale be enlarged on bail in C.R.No. 982/2018 registered with Shirur Police Station on furnishing P.R.Bond of Rs. 25,000/- with one or two solvent sureties in like amount. 3.
