Applicant, namely, Ashwini Sanjay Mane by this application under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure pray for bail in C.R.No.60 of 2019 registered with Phaltan Rural Police Station under Section 306 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n02. Perused the application and say filed by the prosecution at Exh.6. Gone through the investigation papers. Heard learned Advocate for the applicant and the learned A.P.P. for the State. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n03. It is vehemently argued by the learned Advocate for the applicant that, there is inordinate delay in lodging F.I.R. False allegations are levelled against applicant. Applicant is widow. Chargesheet is not yet filed. Applicant is permanent resident of Jalochi, Tal. Baramati, Dist. Pune and she will not misuse her liberty in any manner if so released of bail and will abide any condition if so imposed by the Court. Applicant prayed to allow the application. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n04. Per contra, it is vehemently argued by learned A.P.P. that, investigation is in progress. If applicant is released on bail, possibility can\u0027t be ruled out that she will pressurize the informant and witnesses. Learned A.P.P. prayed to reject the application. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n05. I have gone through the investigation papers. From the complaint of Ashish Anand Sabale dated 11/02/2019, it reveals that, deceased Amit was his brother. Deceased was addict of liquor. In the year 2016, Amit went at the house of Sanjay Mahadeo Mane who is maternal uncle of Ashish. On 03/05/2018, Sanjay Mahadeo Mane died due to T.B. After some days of death of Sanjay Mahadeo Mane, grandmother of complainant by name Parvati Mahadeo Mane caught the applicant and deceased Amit in compromising position and applicant was sent at her parents\u0027 house at Jalochi, Tal. Baramati. However, applicant was making frequent calls to Amit and harassing him. Whenever Amit was talking on phone, he was in tension. On 06/02/2019 at about 4:00 p.m., Amit was abusing someone on phone. On 06/02/2019, last call was received to Amit by applicant and at about 4:00 p.m. Amit consumed poison and committed suicide. From the contents of complaint, it reveals that, due to harassment by applicant, deceased Amit Anand Sabale committed suicide. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n06. First of all, it is necessary to mention here that, alleged incident taken place on 06/02/2019 at about 4:00 p.m. at Khunte, Tal. Phaltan. The complaint was lodged on 11/02/2019. Means, after five days of alleged incident, the complaint is lodged against applicant. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n07. On perusal of remand papers, it reveals that, on 14/02/2019, applicant was remanded in Magisterial Custody. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n08. From the contents of complaint, it reveals that, applicant was harassing deceased Amit by making phone calls and as such due to harassment of applicant, Amit committed suicide by consuming poison. On perusal of complaint, it further reveals that, by making phone calls applicant was harassing Amit and prior to consuming poison, last call was received to Amit from Applicant. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n09. As mentioned earlier, there is delay of five days in lodging the F.I.R. Nothing has to be recovered from the applicant. Chargesheet is not yet filed. Just on the basis that, investigation is in progress and if applicant is released on bail she will pressurize the witnesses and complainant, in my mind, she cannot be kept behind bars for uncertain period. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n10. In my mind, the custodial interrogation of applicant is not at all necessary for investigation. Applicant is permanent resident of Jalochi, Tal. Baramati, Dist. Pune and is widow. Considering the nature of offence, punishment provided for the same, keeping in mind the aspect of delay, I am of the view that, it would be just, proper and judicious to impose some conditions on applicant while releasing her on bail so that she could not misuse her liberty. Hence, I pass following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER 1. The application is allowed. 2. Applicant Ashwini Sanjay Mane be released on bail on executing PB and SB of Rs.15,000/­. 3. The applicant is directed to not to misuse her liberty by any manner and to attend the Phaltan Rural Police Station on every Sunday in between 11:00 a.m. to 02:00 p.m. without fail, till charge­sheet is filed. 4. If it is noticed that, applicant is disobeying the condition by non attending the Police Station, that should be the ground for cancellation of bail of applicant. \r\n---order-ends---\r\nSatara.
