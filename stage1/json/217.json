They were insisting for principal and interest amount. The FIR reflects that on inquiry made by the informant and deceased, these two accused persons have informed that, amount of interest was obtained by the deceased till that day Rs.2,50,000/­ were balance and monthly Rs.25,000/­ interest was also balance. This applicant has disclosed the informant about the Bhishi transaction. Thus the allegations are mainly against the applicant accused and Anwar. Therefore, his presence may be necessary for interrogation. The attendance as per the interim order passed before the I.O. will not be sufficient for that purpose. Therefore, I am not inclined to confirm the order passed below Exh.4. Hence, I pass following order.",

It is contended that, informant\u0027s husband had borrowed loan of Rs. 2,50,000/­ from applicant and accused Anwar Shaikh and in spite of fulfillment of the same with interest, applicant and accused Anwar were demanding money from him, therefore, he committed suicide by hanging himself. A chit was found on the person of the deceased shows names of applicant Ali and accused Anwar. It is also submitted that, present applicant is absconding since registration of the crime.\r\n---argument-ends---\r\n 4) Advocate for applicant argued that, applicant is innocent person, having no connection with this alleged offence and he falsely involved by this complaint. He has no criminal background, he will co­operate with the investigation machinery and will abide every condition imposed by the Court. It is further contended that, the bail application moved by other accused are allowed, therefore, on the ground of parity, this accused be released on bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5) A.P.P. submitted that, there is allegations against the applicant that he has charged huge interest and recovered from the deceased, he exploited the deceased which resulted into abetment of suicide. It is submitted that, if the applicant is released on bail, he will not attend the police station and will not co operate in the investigation. It is further submitted that, applicant is running illegal business of Sawkari and in case of bail, he may indulge himself in such type of offences, so also major part of the investigation such as to collect hand writing of the applicant etc. is to be completed. Hence, he submitted for rejection of the application. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6) Considering the submissions I have to mention that, the allegation is that, the amount was obtained by the deceased by applicant accused and Anwar Shaikh and they were putting pressure on the deceased for recovery of amount despite he has repaid huge amount. They were insisting for principal and interest amount. The FIR reflects that on inquiry made by the informant and deceased, these two accused persons have informed that, amount of interest was obtained by the deceased till that day Rs.2,50,000/­ were balance and monthly Rs.25,000/­ interest was also balance. This applicant has disclosed the informant about the Bhishi transaction. Thus the allegations are mainly against the applicant accused and Anwar. Therefore, his presence may be necessary for interrogation. The attendance as per the interim order passed before the I.O. will not be sufficient for that purpose. Therefore, I am not inclined to confirm the order passed below Exh.4. Hence, I pass following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER 1) Criminal Misc.
