State of Maharashtra) CNR : MHST01­000412­2019 \r\n---header-ends---\r\n1) Present application is filed by the applicants namely, Milind Madhukar Dangare, Jayshree Sambhaji Bhosale, Vitthal Kondiba Sonavane, Sangita Vitthal Sonavane, Mukund Vithoba Wamane and Vikas Anant Dhole, under section 438 of Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 apprehending their arrest, under C.R. no. 28/2019 registered at Phaltan city police station, at the instance of Seema Anant Tupe, for alleged commission of offence punishable under section 420 r/w. 34 of Indian Penal Code, 1860 and hence have approached Court seeking pre­arrest bail. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2) Vide endorsement dated 13/02/2019 \u0026 07/03/2019, application was \u0027Not pressed\u0027, in respect of applicant no. 2 Jayashree Sambhaji Bhosale and applicant no. 6 Vikas Anant Dhole respectively, \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3) Advocate for applicants argued that, applicants as well as the informant, are devotees of \u0027Amma­Bhagwan\u0027. Allegations against applicants are that, applicants have collected amounts under pretext of constructing Amma\u0027s temple. It was contended that FIR is false, frivolously and belatedly filed after inordinate delay of more than one and half month. It is contended that, the dispute, if at all, involves money, is civil dispute in nature, applicants are ready to co­operate in the investigation. Accordingly, contended protection by grant of pre­arrest bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4) Bail application is resisted by the APP by filing say at Exh. 9 on the grounds that, applicants presented one dummy person as \u0027Amma­Bhagwan\u0027 collected Rs. 21,000/­ from the informant under pretext of constructing Amma\u0027s temple. Accordingly, cheated the informant. It is contended that, custodial investigation is required to find out the actual amount collected and the number of instances during which applicants have committed such offence. Accordingly, bail is resisted. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5) During the course of arguments, upon perusal of records, it was observed that, interim anticipatory bail application of these applicants was rejected vide order dated 06/02/2019. It is settled position of law that, once interim pre­arrest bail application is rejected, the proper course will be to reject the pre­ arrest bail application. In such circumstances, once the interim pre­arrest bail application Exh. 4 was rejected, the present main pre­arrest bail application itself cannot survive. That apart, considering the nature of offences alleged, thorough investigation undisputedly is required. Therefore, applicants have not made out any case for being protested by grant of pre­arrest bail. Hence, the following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER Criminal Bail Application no. 88/2019, is rejected. \r\n---order-ends---\r\n(Y. H. Ameta) Place : Satara Addl.
