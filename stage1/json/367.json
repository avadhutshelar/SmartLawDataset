Therefore, it would be just and proper to release the applicant/accused on bail. In the result, I pass following order :­",

Bail Application No. 19/2019 [CNR No.MHPU140001032019] Sachin Dipak Gaikwad Age – 25 years, Occ –Labour R/at – MIDC, Baramati, Tal­Baramati, Dist­Pune .... Applicant V/s. State of Maharashtra, Through Incharge of Baramati Taluka Police Station, Tal­Baramati, Dist­Pune … Opponent \r\n---header-ends---\r\nORDER BELOW BAIL APPLICATION EXH­1 1] The applicant/accused filed present bail application under section 439 of Cr.P.C. for his release on bail in C.R. No. 699/2018, registered with Baramati Taluka Police Station for the offences under section 363, 366(A), 376 (i)(n), 343 of I.P.C. and section 4,5,6,8 of Protection of Children From Sexual Offices Act. The allegation against the applicant are that on 10­11­2018 the accused kidnapped the victim, and during 10­11­2018 to 23­12­2018 wrongfully confined the victim having age about 16 years, at the house of his brother­in­law at village Gojubavi and afterwards at Malegaon in the room of his friend, and from time to time committed rape/sexual penetrative assault upon the victim. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2] The applicant is arrested on 5­1­2019 and since then he is in custody. The applicant/accused stated that he is innocent person, he has been falsely implicated. The informant who is mother of the victim has filed similar kind of FIR against several persons, and is in habit of filing false cases. There is delay in filing the FIR. The applicant/accused is permanent residence at MIDC Baramati and he is not likely to abscond. Hence, he requested to release him on bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3] The investigating officer and APP opposed the application on the ground that the offences are serious, the accused if release on bail may pressurize the victim. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4] The informant who is mother of the victim filed her affidavit Exh­6 and gave no objection to release the accused on bail stating that due to misunderstanding she has filed incorrect FIR. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5] I heard advocate R.D. Kshirsagar for the applicant and APP Smt. S.K. Naik for the prosecution. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6] It appears from record that on 23­12­2018 the victim under \u0027Burkha\u0027 went in the locality of her house, where her mother informant was residing and that time the informant and one Bapu followed her, caught hold her and produced before the police. Thereafter the victim made statement before the police alleging her wrongful confinement and sexual relation between her and the accused under the assumption that the accused would marry with her as promise by him. It also appears from copy of FIR in CR 6/2018 filed by informant similar kind of case in respect of earlier incident in February 2018 is also registered against some other person. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n7] Ld. Advocate Kshirsagar relied on ratio in Sunil Mahadeo Patil Vs. State Of Maharashtra in Bail Application No. 1036/2015 decided on 3­8­2015, wherein the Hon\u0027ble Bombay High Court has held that when a boy and a minor girl are in love with each other and choose to live together, then considering the circumstances, the court may release the accused on bail. In the present case before me the age of victim is about 16 years, thus she is matured to understand the consequences of her going with the accused and his friend and to stay with the accused. Therefore, in my view, considering the fact that the accused gave promise to marry to the victim and then the victim stayed with the accused and they made sexual relation point out their love relation. Therefore, it would be just and proper to release the applicant/accused on bail. In the result, I pass following order :­ \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER 1] Criminal Bail application No. 19/2019 is allowed. 2] The applicant/accused Sachin Dipak Gaikwad in C.R. No. 699/2018, registered with Baramati Taluka Police Station for the offences under section 363, 366(A), 376 (i)(n), 343 of I.P.C. and section 4,5,6,8 of Protection of Children From Sexual Offices Act be released on executing PR bond of Rs. 25000/­ with one surety of like amount. 3] The applicant is directed to remain present before investigating officer at Baramati Taluka Police Station on every Tuesday between 11.00 a.m. to 1.00 p.m. till filing the chargesheet. 4] The applicant is also directed not to contact and pressurize the victim and prosecution witnesses. \r\n---order-ends---\r\nDate : 22­01­2019 (N.B.
