  "processedText": "ORDER BELOW EXH.01 IN CRI. BAIL APPLN. NO. 82/2019 Shankar Maruti Kadake Vs. State of Maharashtra \r\n---header-ends---\r\nThis is an application for regular bail as per section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Heard advocate Mr. H. B. Dhaygude for applicant. He submitted that in Crime No.225/2018 registered with Khandala Police Station for the offences punishable under sections 498­A, 306 etc. read with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, applicant is behind the bars since 21/12/2018. He was remanded in police custody till 24/12/2011 and since then he is in Magisterial custody. Part of his custodial interrogation is over. He is falsely implicated at the instance of his brother in law. He is local resident and the sole earning member in the family. His deceased wife has left behind two small children. He has to take their care. He is ready to furnish surety to the satisfaction of this Court and is also ready to obey with all the conditions those may be imposed upon him. His entire family is dependent upon him. Other two accused are already released on bail. Therefore he prayed that by imposing certain conditions, applicant may be released on bail. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2. APP Mrs. Diwakar by filing her say at Exh.5 strongly resisted the application. She submitted that applicant subjected her wife with cruelty of physical and mental type. He harassed her on flimsy grounds by keeping her on starvation. She could not tolerate his ill treatment and committed suicide by hanging from the tree. Investigation is in progress. If he is released on bail then he is likely to tamper with the evidence of prosecution. Therefore she submitted that application may be rejected. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3. After going through the FIR dated 21/12/2018, it is seen that there are general allegations against applicant of cruelty of both the types. Their marriage was performed in the year 2009 and they had begotten two children out of the wedlock. However, after his arrest applicant was in the custody of police for three days and since then he is in Magisterial custody. He is behind the bars since 21/12/2018 that is for the period of more than about two months. Alleged offences are not punishable with death or imprisonment for life. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4. Applicant is local resident and happens to be the sole earning member in his family. He has two small children to look after. When he has already undergone custodial interrogation then no purpose of the prosecution would be served by keeping him behind the bars for an inordinate period. Informant and witnesses are residing at Hingangaon Tal. Phaltan while applicant is resident of Kesurdi Tal. Khandala. If some conditions are imposed then it would serve the purpose of prosecution. Hence the order follows :­ \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER 1 Application is allowed. 2 In Crime No. 225/2018 registered with Khandala Police Station for the offences punishable under sections 498­A, 306 etc. read with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, applicant Shankar Maruti Khadake, be released on bail upon his executing P.R.
