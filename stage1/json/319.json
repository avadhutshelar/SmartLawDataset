  "processedText": "ORDER BELOW EXH.01 IN CRI. BAIL APPLN. NO. 127/2019 MHST01­000639­2019 Akshay Madhukar Gaikwad Vs. State of Maharashtra \r\n---header-ends---\r\nThis is an application for regular bail as per section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. \r\n---background-ends---\r\nHeard advocate Mr. Todkar for applicant. He submitted that in Crime No.41/2019 registered with Satara Taluka Police Station for the offences punishable under sections 376(2)(n) etc. of the Indian Penal Code, applicant is behind the bars since 12/02/2019. He has undergone custodial interrogation for two days i.e. till 14/02/2019 and since then he is in Magisterial custody. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n2. According to him, applicant is innocent. After going through the FIR, it is seen that the prosecutrix and applicant were in consensual relationship. She has lodged the false FIR belatedly and merely to harass this applicant and with an ulterior motive. She is matured and married. Applicant is of young age and sole earning member in the family. He is ready to obey with all the conditions those may be imposed upon him. Therefore he submitted that by imposing certain conditions, applicant may be released on bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3. He relied upon the case of Dr. Dhruvaram Muralidhar Sonar Vs. The State of Maharashtra, reported in 2019 ALL MR (Cri) 771 (S.C.), in which it is held by Hon\u0027ble Apex Court that, “where prosecutrix gives consent out of her love and passion or where accused fails to marry prosecutrix due to some unforeseen reasons, consensual sex in such cases would not attract offence punishable under section 376 of the Indian Penal Code.” \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4. APP Mrs. Diwakar by filing say at Exh.6 strongly resisted the application. She replied that though prosecutrix is married and is given in marriage at Chiplun, applicant by calling her to Pune and thereafter at Vadhe­Phata, committed rape upon her. Thereafter he took her to his house and again maintained sexual relations with her. Thereafter he refused to marry her. He gave threats to the prosecutrix. Both of them are residents of same village. If applicant is released on bail then he is likely to pressurize her. Therefore she submitted that application may be rejected. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5. After going through the FIR lodged by the informant, it is seen that she is in consensual sexual relationship with this applicant since the month of January 2018. Last incident quoted by her is of 28/01/2019. She has lodged the FIR on 11/02/2019. She is matured lady of 21 years. Since prior to her marriage, she is in sexual relationship with this applicant. When she went to applicant at 12.00 midnight behind her house, did not raise any hue and cry till lodging of the FIR, she went with him to Pune, stayed along­with him in a rented room near Civil Hospital, Satara for one week then there appears substance in the case made out by applicant for his release on bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6. Applicant has already undergone custodial interrogation and he is behind the bars since 12/02/2019 i.e. for the period more than one month. Practically by this time, investigation might have been completed. There is no propriety in keeping him behind the bars for an inordinate period. If some conditions are imposed then it would serve the purpose of prosecution. Because admittedly the prosecutrix is given in marriage at Chiplun, District­ Ratnagiri. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n7. I have carefully gone through facts of the cited case Dr. Dhruvaram Muralidhar Sonar Vs. The State of Maharashtra, on which advocate of applicant placed his reliance. Facts of this cited case are exactly identical with the case at hands and therefore the law laid down therein by Hon\u0027ble Apex Court squarely applies to this case. Hence the order follows :­ \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER 1 Application is allowed. 2 In Crime No. 41/2019 registered with Satara Taluka Police Station for the offences punishable under sections 363, 376(2)(n) of the Indian Penal Code, applicant Akshay Madhukar Gaikwad, be released on bail upon his executing P.R. Bond of Rs.25,000/­ (Rs. Twenty five thousands) with one solvent surety in the like amount on following conditions : 4/4 Criminal Bail Application No. 127/2019 i) that he shall attend Satara Taluka Police Station on every Sunday in between 11.00 a.m. to 1.00 p.m. till filing of the charge­sheet. ii) that he shall not directly or indirectly, make any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the accusation against him so as to dissuade him from disclosing such facts to the Court or to any police officer. iii) that he shall not tamper with the evidence of prosecution in any manner. iv. that he shall not make contact, in any manner with the informant/prosecutrix either at her maternal home or at her marital home. If he is found to have made contact with her and tried to establish sexual relations with her then the bail granted to him shall automatically stand cancelled. 3 Failure to obey any of the conditions above, would be liable to cancellation of bail granted to applicant. 4 Bail before the lower Court. 5 Inform Satara Taluka Police Station accordingly. (Order is dictated and pronounced in the open Court). \r\n---order-ends---\r\nSatara (R.D.Deshpande) Dt. 20/03/2019. Additional Sessions Judge, Satara."
