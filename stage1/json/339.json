He submitted that quarrel took place in between the informant, her family members and these applicants on account of obstruction of funeral procession on the dead­body. The mob was proceeding by the private property of the informant. Moreover son of the informant disclosed some corruption matters of applicant No.1. Being aggrieved, this applicant and others formed an unlawful assembly. They were armed with deadly weapons. In the presence of police officials, they have assaulted the informant and her family members. In the said incident, one of the accused namely Ramdas Kadav tried to run over the informant\u0027s son Ramesh by his vehicle so also he assaulted the informant on her head. The family members of informant are also injured in this incident. The weapons like wooden logs, iron rods, stones etc. are used in the commission of offence. Atmosphere in the village is tense due to cross complaints. In case of release of applicant on bail, there is likelihood of repetition of such type of offences at his hands. There is also likelihood of tampering with the evidence of prosecution. There is danger to the lives of informant and her family members. On all these grounds, he submitted that application may be rejected.",

State of Maharashtra \r\n---header-ends---\r\nThis is an application for regular bail as per section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Heard advocate Mr. S. V. Begampure, for applicant. He submitted that in Crime No. 58/2019 registered with Satara Taluka Police Station for the offences punishable under sections 307 etc. read with section 149 of the Indian Penal Code, applicant is behind the bars since 24/02/2019. He was remanded in police custody till 27/02/2019 and thereafter he is in Magisterial custody. Part of his custodial interrogation is over. His further presence is no more required by the police. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2. He further submitted that applicant is innocent and has not committed any offence. In fact informant and her relatives obstructed the funeral procession of one lady namely Suman Pralhad Sabale of the village Sabalewadi on 24/02/2019 on the ground that procession was being taken from their land. In fact the informant and the party have beaten seriously this applicant and his family members and the informant has lodged false FIR against this applicant and others to implicate them. Applicant is respectable person in the society. There is civil dispute pending in between the parties on account of approach way to the cremation ground. For that purpose he invited my attention to various documents placed on record including the FIR lodged by the party of this applicant against informant and her family members. He also invited my attention to the photographs produced on record along­with list at Exh.10 and submitted that informant party was aggressive in the commission of offence as they were armed with deadly weapons like wooden logs. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3. He also submitted that applicant is local resident. He is of young age and an agriculturist by profession. He is the sole earning member in his family. There is no reason to keep him behind the bars for an inordinate period as his family members are suffering starvation. He is ready to obey with all the conditions those may be imposed upon him. He has no antecedents. On all these grounds, he prayed that applicant may be released on bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4. APP Mr. Oak by filing say at Exh.5 strongly resisted the application. He replied that alleged offences are serious. He submitted that quarrel took place in between the informant, her family members and these applicants on account of obstruction of funeral procession on the dead­body. The mob was proceeding by the private property of the informant. Moreover son of the informant disclosed some corruption matters of applicant No.1. Being aggrieved, this applicant and others formed an unlawful assembly. They were armed with deadly weapons. In the presence of police officials, they have assaulted the informant and her family members. In the said incident, one of the accused namely Ramdas Kadav tried to run over the informant\u0027s son Ramesh by his vehicle so also he assaulted the informant on her head. The family members of informant are also injured in this incident. The weapons like wooden logs, iron rods, stones etc. are used in the commission of offence. Atmosphere in the village is tense due to cross complaints. In case of release of applicant on bail, there is likelihood of repetition of such type of offences at his hands. There is also likelihood of tampering with the evidence of prosecution. There is danger to the lives of informant and her family members. On all these grounds, he submitted that application may be rejected. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5. From the photographs placed on record, it is seen that incident has taken place in the presence of police officials. In the commission of offences, deadly weapons like wooden logs, iron rods and stones are used. Informant and her family members are seriously injured in the incident. Informant has sustained fracture injury. There are two rival groups and have filed cross complaints against each other. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6. Apart from that situation in the village is tense. Taking into consideration the rivalry and previous quarrels in between the parties on account of approach way to the cremation ground, it would not be just and safe to grant bail to this applicant. Moreover as stated by the prosecution in its say, there is danger to the lives of informant and her family members at the hands of applicant. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n7. Considering the nature and gravity of offences so also the seriousness of accusation, applicant is not entitled for bail. Investigation is in progress. As such it would not be just and safe to release this applicant on bail. If bail is granted to him then entire investigation would be paralyzed. Hence the order follows :­ \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER Application is rejected. (Order is dictated and pronounced in the open Court) \r\n---order-ends---\r\nSatara (R.D.Deshpande) Dt.12/03/2019. Additional Sessions Judge, Satara."
