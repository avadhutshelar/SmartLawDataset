State of Maharashtra) CNR : MHST01­000560­2019 \r\n---header-ends---\r\n1) Present bail application is preferred by the applicants under section 439 of Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 seeking their release from having being arrested under execution of non bailable warrant issued by Ld. J.M.F.C. Khandala in R.C.C. no. 46/2015. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2) It is contended by applicant\u0027s advocate that, accused are arrested under execution of NBW at the time the accused\u0027s preferred application for cancellation of the said warrants. It is contended that, the present accused out of inadvertence and miscommunication with their advocate, did not have proper knowledge of the date of hearing and remained absent. It is contended that, all the accused undertake to attend every date of hearing henceforth and to coperate in expediting the trial. Accordingly, bail is contended. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3) Bail application is resisted by the APP by filing say at Exh. 4 on the grounds that, accused are arrested in breach of conditions as per section 436(2) of Criminal Procedure Code, 1973, hence are not entitled for bail. It is contended that, in case of released on bail, they may abscond and protract the trial. Accordingly, bail is resisted. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4) Upon hearing the APP and applicant\u0027s advocate and perusing the papers, it appears that, applicants/accused are arrested under execution of NBW issued by the Ld. JMFC Khandala. Perusal of the record reveals that, there are other persons are also arrayed as accused in the matter. Thus, it cannot be said that, the trial was protected only due to absence of these accused. In such circumstances, keeping the accused arrested pending the trial, would amount to punishment before trial, which is not justifiable. At the same time, APP\u0027s apprehensions shall also have to be considered for ensuring accused\u0027s presence at the hearing and facing trial. The same can be secured by subjecting the accused to certain conditions. Hence, the following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nO R D E R 1) Criminal Bail Application no. 109/2019, is allowed; 2) Applicant no. 1 Pradip Ramchandra Mane, no. 2 Manoj Jagadevarao Deshmukh, no. 3 Rahul Krishna Kamble, no. 4 Rahul @ Mahesh Prakash Khalekar, no. 5 Sampat Pandurang Magar, no. 6 Sagar Shivaji Khalekar, no. 7 Krishna Prakash Shinde, no. 8 Abhijit Kashinath Khade, no. 9 Sanjay Shankararao Deshmukh and no. 10 Rahul Prabhakar Hadke, be released on bail from their arrest under execution of NBW issued in R.C.C. no. 46/2015 upon paying penalty of Rs. 2,000/­ each (Rs.Two Thousand Hundred each); and executing personal bond of Rs.25,000/­ each (Rs.
