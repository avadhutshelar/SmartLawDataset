    "text": "This is an application for anticipatory bail as per section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Heard advocate Mr. D. S. Ghadage for applicants. He submitted that Crime No. 51/2019 is registered against these applicants with Satara Taluka Police Station for the offences punishable under sections 498­A etc. read with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code. Applicants are having strong apprehension of their arrest in this crime. But applicants are innocent. The FIR lodged by wife of applicant No.1 is false and concocted. In fact applicant No.1 has filed Hindu Marriage Petition No. 82/2019 for annulment of marriage under section 12 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. In order to give counter blast to that petition, she has lodged the false FIR.",

State of Maharashtra CNR­MHST01­000683­2019 \r\n---header-ends---\r\nThis is an application for anticipatory bail as per section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Heard advocate Mr. D. S. Ghadage for applicants. He submitted that Crime No. 51/2019 is registered against these applicants with Satara Taluka Police Station for the offences punishable under sections 498­A etc. read with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code. Applicants are having strong apprehension of their arrest in this crime. But applicants are innocent. The FIR lodged by wife of applicant No.1 is false and concocted. In fact applicant No.1 has filed Hindu Marriage Petition No. 82/2019 for annulment of marriage under section 12 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. In order to give counter blast to that petition, she has lodged the false FIR. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2. He further submitted that applicants are respectable persons. If they are arrested then their reputation would be maligned. They would suffer an irreparable loss. FIR is lodged belatedly after about two months. Applicants are ready to obey with all the conditions those may be imposed upon them. Therefore he prayed that pre­arrest protection may be granted to applicants. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3. APP Mrs. Diwakar by filing say at Exh.9 resisted the application. She replied that all these applicants subjected the informant with cruelty of physical and mental type. They also made an unlawful demand of money from her from time to time and for the non­fulfillment of such unlawful demand, they ill­ treated her. Investigation is in progress. In case of release of these applicants on anticipatory bail there are chances of pressurizing witnesses of the prosecution by them. Custodial interrogation of these applicants is necessary. Therefore she prayed that application may be rejected. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4. After going through the FIR lodged by informant, this Court has already granted ad­interim pre­arrest protection to these applicants by way of order dated 22/02/2019. Considering the say filed by prosecution, the only grievance raised is that there is likelihood of tampering with the evidence of prosecution in case of release of these applicants on anticipatory bail. However, this Court has taken care of that aspect while passing order below application for ad­interim anticipatory bail at Exh.4. A condition is imposed upon all these applicants that they shall not in any manner make any contact with informant and witnesses. Satara Taluka Police Station is also already informed about it. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5. As per the directions of this Court, all the applicants are marking their presence before the Investigating Officer. It is nowhere mentioned in the application that after passing order regarding ad­interim pre­arrest protection, these applicants have flouted any of the conditions imposed upon them. Custodial interrogation of these applicants is not at all warranted as there is nothing which is to be seized from them. It is already observed that applicants No.1 and 3 are likely to loose their job if they are arrested and applicants No.3 and 4 are old aged. 6. Considering these aspects, ad­interim pre­arrest protection granted to applicants vide order below application at Exh.4 deserves to be confirmed on the same conditions. Hence the order follows :­ \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER 1 Application is allowed. 2 In the event of their arrest in Crime No. 51/2019 registered with Satara Taluka Police Station for the offences punishable under sections 498­A etc. read with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, applicant No. 1 Gaurav Dattatray Mahamulkar, applicant No.2 Sou. Sujata Dattatray Mahamulkar, applicant No.3 Shubham Dattatray Mahamulkar and applicant No.4 Dattatray Shivaji Mahamulkar, be released on anticipatory bail, upon their executing P. R. Bonds of Rs.15,000/­ (Rs. fifteen thousands) by each with one surety in the like amount by each, on following conditions : i. that applicants shall attend Satara Taluka Police Station on every Sunday in between 11.00 a.m. to 12.00 noon until further orders. ii. that they shall not directly or indirectly, make any 4/4 Criminal Misc.
