State of Maharashtra \r\n---header-ends---\r\nThis is an application for anticipatory bail as per section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Heard advocate Miss. Wagh for applicant. She submitted that Crime No.136/2018 is registered against this applicant with Satara Taluka Police Station for the offences punishable under sections 392 etc. of the Indian Penal Code. \r\n---background-ends---\r\nApplicant is apprehending his arrest in this crime. He is innocent and he has not committed any offence. He is falsely implicated in this crime by other accused who came to be arrested by the police. Applicant is of young age and is in service. If he is arrested then he would suffer an irreparable loss and his reputation would be maligned. He is ready to obey with all the conditions those may be imposed upon him. Therefore she submitted that by imposing certain conditions, applicant may be released on anticipatory bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n2. APP Mr. Oak by filing say at Exh.7 strongly resisted the application. He replied that one Shakil Abraham Shaikh has lodged the FIR on 17/02/2018. He has specifically mentioned the names of other accused in the FIR and has also stated that one unknown person was also accompanying them. Accused who is arrested, has disclosed name of this applicant as he shared common intention to commit the offence of robbery and giving threats etc. The looted property is yet to be recovered. Unless this applicant is arrested, no progress can be made in the investigation. On all these grounds, he submitted that application may be rejected. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3. After going through the police papers, especially the remand report, it is seen that name of this applicant is transpired during the course of investigation. Golden ornaments worth Rs.8000/­, cash amount, he­goat and she­goat worth Rs.8000/­ are robbed at the point of an axe and giving threats. Stolen property is yet to be recovered. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4. Considering the nature and gravity of offences so also the seriousness of accusation, custodial interrogation of this applicant is warranted. As such it would not be just and safe to release this applicant on anticipatory bail. If such pre­arrest protection is granted to him then the stolen property may not be recovered and further investigation would be paralyzed. Hence the order follows :­ \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER Application is rejected. (Order is dictated and pronounced in the open Court) \r\n---order-ends---\r\nSatara (R.D.Deshpande) Dt.12/03/2019. Additional Sessions Judge, Satara."
