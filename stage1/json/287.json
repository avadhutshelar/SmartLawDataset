On perusal of another certificate dated 26.02.2019 which was shown by learned A.P.P. at the time of argument, it reveals that, on 05.02.2019 applicant was present in the College till 01.10 p.m. The alleged incident had been taken place on 05.02.2019 at about 03.00 p.m. The certificates dated 07.02.2019, 14.02.2019 and 26.02.2019 were issued by the Principal of Someshwar Science College, Someshwarnagar, Taluka Baramati, District Pune. The contents of certificate dated 07.02.2019 and 14.02.2019 are falsified by certificate dated 26.02.2019. On the basis of certificate dated 26.02.2019 it can be said that, on 05.02.2019 applicant was present in College at the most till 01.10 p.m. As mentioned earlier, alleged incident had taken place on 05.02.2019 at 03.00 p.m. Considering the distance between Someshwarnagar and Ambavde it cannot be said that, it was not possible for applicant to reach to village Ambavde on 05.02.2019 at about 03.00 p.m.",

The applicant, namely, Ajinkya Pandharinath Takavale apprehending his arrest in C.R.No.16 of 2019 for the offence punishable under Section 436 r/w 34 of the Indian Penal Code, registered with Wathar Police Station, has filed this application under Section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for anticipatory bail. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n02. Perused application. Heard learned Advocate Shri.S.R.Chavan for the applicant and learned A.P.P. Shri.N.D.Muke for State. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n03. From the contents of complaint of Ashok Tukaram Sakunde dated 05.02.2019 in C.R.No.16 of 2019, it reveals that, on 05.02.2019, at about 03.00 p.m., when he, his wife and daughter­in­law were in kitchen and after hearing the noise of their labours, complainant and his family members came outside the house and noticed that, partition of kitchen prepared from grass was burning. Complainant noticed applicant and two unknown boys were going on red colour without number Bullet motorcycle. Complainant tried to chase them, but it was unsuccessful attempt. The labour of complainant by name Mahesh Hindurao Landage and other labours told complainant that, three persons came on Bullet motorcycle and burnt partition of kitchen of complainant prepared from grass. From the contents of complaint, it reveals that, son of complainant by name Sandip and daughter of Pandharinath Takawale by name Neha performed love marriage in January 2019 and applicant earlier threatened complainant on mobile to burn the house of complainant. FIR was lodged on 05.02.2019 at about 10.07 p.m. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n04. From the contents of application, it reveals that, false complaint is lodged against applicant. The relations of complainant and family members of applicant are strained due to the love marriage of son of complainant and sister of applicant. At the time of incident, applicant was present at his College. Applicant is 18 years old and having good educational background and also won some prizes of Athletic. Applicant is permanent resident of Lathe, Taluka Baramati, District Pune. There is no likelihood that applicant will abscond. Applicant is ready to abide any condition, if so imposed by the Court. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n05. From the say of learned A.P.P. at Exh.10, it reveals that, the names of unknown accused are yet to be transpired. Without custody of applicant the unknown accused will not be traced out. After arresting the applicant and unknown accused their identification parade is to be carried out. Yet the vehicle used in offence is not seized. So, the material used for setting fire is also not yet seized. The relations between applicant and complainant\u0027s family members became strained, as such, accused will commit such type of offence again. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n06. It is argued by learned Advocate for applicant that, on 05.02.2019, during whole day, applicant was present at Someshwar College. It is further argued that, at least two hours are required by vehicle to come to Ambavde from Someshwarnagar, Taluka Baramati. As on 05.02.2019 applicant was present in his College whole day, it was not possible for applicant to come to village Ambavde at the residence of complainant on 05.02.2019 at about 03.00 p.m. It is further argued that, as sister of applicant performed love marriage with the son of complainant, applicant is falsely involved in present crime. There is delay in lodging FIR. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n07. It is argued by learned A.P.P. that, the custodial interrogation of applicant is necessary. Yet two unknown accused are to be arrested. The material used for setting fire is not seized. The vehicle involved in offence is not seized. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n08. Gone through the documents filed by applicant. To support his contention, learned Advocate for applicant relied upon certificate of Principal of Someshwar Science College, Someshwarnagar, Taluka Baramati, District Pune, dated 07.02.2019. Another certificate dated 14.02.2019 is also placed on record. From certificate dated 07.02.2019, it reveals that, the timing of attendance of applicant in College was not mentioned in it. Certificate dated 14.02.2019 indicates that, on the date of incident from 09.40 a.m. to 04.00 p.m. applicant was present at College. On perusal of another certificate dated 26.02.2019 which was shown by learned A.P.P. at the time of argument, it reveals that, on 05.02.2019 applicant was present in the College till 01.10 p.m. The alleged incident had been taken place on 05.02.2019 at about 03.00 p.m. The certificates dated 07.02.2019, 14.02.2019 and 26.02.2019 were issued by the Principal of Someshwar Science College, Someshwarnagar, Taluka Baramati, District Pune. The contents of certificate dated 07.02.2019 and 14.02.2019 are falsified by certificate dated 26.02.2019. On the basis of certificate dated 26.02.2019 it can be said that, on 05.02.2019 applicant was present in College at the most till 01.10 p.m. As mentioned earlier, alleged incident had taken place on 05.02.2019 at 03.00 p.m. Considering the distance between Someshwarnagar and Ambavde it cannot be said that, it was not possible for applicant to reach to village Ambavde on 05.02.2019 at about 03.00 p.m. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n09. The alleged incident had taken place on 05.02.2019 at about 03.00 p.m. Complaint is lodged on 05.02.2019 at 10.07 p.m. Though there is somewhat delay is lodging the complaint, at this stage it cannot be inferred that, applicant is falsely involved due to strained relations between family members of applicant and complainant. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n10. From the statement of Neha Sandip Sakunde dated 06.02.2019 (who is sister of applicant), it reveals that, she has seen the applicant running from the spot of incident after the incident. Neha is sister of applicant, as such, she was firmly knowing applicant. From her statement it also reveals that, earlier applicant also threatened Neha and her family members to set fire their house. From the complaint dated 05.02.2019, it reveals that, at the time of incident complainant, his wife Laxmi, son Sandip and daughter­in­law Neha were present in kitchen. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n11. From the contents of complaint, prima facie it reveals that, the complainant and his labours noticed the applicant and two unknown persons fleeing away on one unnumbered Bullet motorcycle from the spot of incident. Prima facie, at least presence of applicant seems to be probable on the spot of incident on the date and time of the incident. Admittedly, the son of complainant by name Sandip has performed love marriage with the sister of applicant. Hence, prima facie it can be held that, there was grudge in the mind of applicant against complainant. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n12. Prima facie, it does not reveal that, applicant is falsely involved in the alleged crime due to the strained relations between family members of complainant and applicant. Considering the nature of offence, considering the punishment provided for the alleged offence i.e. imprisonment for life or with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years and shall also be liable to fine, considering the prima facie presence of the applicant on the spot of incident, I am of the view that, custodial interrogation of applicant is necessary to know as to the unknown absconding accused. For the reasons mentioned above, I am of the view that, even considering the age of applicant this is not a fit case to grant protection to applicant. Hence, I proceed to pass the following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nO R D E R 1. Anticipatory bail application of applicant, namely, 6 Cri.M.A.No.95 of 2019 (Exh.1) Ajinkya Pandharinath Takavale is hereby rejected. 2. Issue notice to Principal of Someshwar Science College, Someshwarnagar, Taluka Baramati, District Pune, returnable on 25.03.2019, calling his say on what basis he had issued certificates dated 07.02.2019 and 14.02.2019. \r\n---order-ends---\r\nDate : 13.03.2019.
