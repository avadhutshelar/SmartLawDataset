(Presided over by S.T.Bhalerao, Addl.Sessions Judge) Criminal Bail Application No. : 04 of 2019 . (CNR NO. : MHPU14­000011­2019) Applicant : Sunita Sugriv Garde // VERSUS // Non­applicant : \r\n---header-ends---\r\n1] State of Maharashtra Through Police Station Officer, Police Station Indapur, District Pune. ORDER BELOW EXHIBIT 1. ( Passed on this 02 February, 2019 ) This is an application for grant of bail in Crime No. 987/2018 under Sections 306, 304B, 498 A, r.w.34 of the Indian Penal Code registered at Police Station Indapur, Dist. Pune filed under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2] It is contended that the present accused has never committed the alleged crime. She had never demanded the dowry, never illtreated, mentally tortured or abetted to suicide to the sister of the informant. There is no direct evidence against the applicant. The ingredients of section 304B and 306 are not attracted. She is not having any criminal antecedent. She is local resident of Village Galandwadi. She will not abscond or flee away from the jurisdiction of the Court. She is ready to abide by all conditions imposed on her. The major investigation of this crime is completed and no custodial interrogation is required. She will not tamper prosecution evidence and will Sunita Garde cooperate the police machinery in the investigation. It is prayed to allow the application. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3] The Investigation Officer and the learned A.P.P. opposed the application by filing say. It is submitted that this accused being mother in law of deceased Shital and other two accused, subjected Shital to cruelty – mental and physical – which ultimately led to taking the drastic step by Shital. The ill treatment was on the count of money and Shital\u0027s not conceiving. It is submitted that fed up with the ill treatment Shital committed suicide by ingesting poison. If the accused are released, they could pressurize the witnesses and would not fear law. The investigation is incomplete. Hence, the application for bail be rejected. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4] Heard both the sides. I perused the copy of case diary by APP and copy of charge sheet by advocate for accused. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5] The learned Advocate for the accused submitted that now the investigation has been completed and charge sheet has been presented to the Court. It is submitted that the accused is middle age woman and further detention is not necessary. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6] The learned A.P.P. reiterated the contentions made in the say. It is submitted to reject the application. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n7] On perusal of the case diary and the copy of charge sheet it is seen that prima facie the involvement of accused in commission of crime is apparent. Unfortunate Shital met untimely death less than three years from she wed to accused no. 1.
