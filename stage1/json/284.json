It is pointed out that, there is delay of around 4 days in lodging FIR. It is submitted that, applicant is the Manager in O.N.G.C. at Mumbai and he is not involved in alleged crime. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5) Learned A.P.P. submitted that, custodial interrogation of accused is necessary and the stolen articles are to be seized. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6) From the papers it seems that, according to the informant, incident occurred on 11.01.2019, FIR is lodged on 15.01.2019 but on 12.01.2019, applicant himself has made an application to police station informing the police about the civil dispute and initiation of various proceedings by the informant. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n7) It is submitted that, applicant has not co­operated in investigation.

Hence, following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER 1) Criminal Bail Application no. 92/2019, is allowed. 2) Interim pre­arrest bail order dated 08.02.2019 passed below Exh. 4, stands confirmed with conditions therein. \r\n---order-ends---\r\n(B.S.Wavre) Place : Satara Addl.
