The applicant, namely, Prakash Shamrao Burunge apprehending his arrest in C.R.No.300 of 2018 for the offences punishable under Section 304(2), 338, 279 of the Indian Penal Code and Section 184, 134(a)(b) of the Motor Vehicles Act registered with Shirwal Police Station has filed this application for anticipatory bail. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n02. Perused application and say of learned A.P.P. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n03. From the contents of complaint of Khishor Jaysing Nalawade in C.R.No.300 of 2018, it reveals that, the alleged incident had taken place on 17/12/2018 during night. On 17/12/2018 at about 5­30 a.m. one unknown phone came to Shirval police station and police came to know about the accident. From the contents of F.I.R., it reveals that, the alleged accident had taken place within the vicinity of village Shirwal in front of Abhinav Agro Mall on Satara­ Pune road. From the F.I.R. it reveals that complaint was lodged on 24/12/2018. From the F.I.R. it further reveals that the unknown vehicle dahed to the deceased. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n04. From the say of Ld. A.P.P. at Exh.11, it revels that after the accident, applicant went away from the spot of incident. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n05. According to applicant, there is delay of 7 days in lodging the complaint. On 17/12/2018 accused was driver on Shivshahi bus i.e. Vallabhnagar to Chiplun and no accident had taken place by him. False complaint is lodged against him. Applicant is only earning source of his family. If applicant is released on anticipatory bail, he will ready to abide any condition if so imposed by the Court. Per contra, it is vehemently argued by the Ld. A.P.P. that, if applicant is released on anticipatory bail, there is every likelihood that he will misuse his liberty due to which investigation would hamper. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n06. I have gone through the record. On perusal of record, it reveals that, the alleged incident had taken place on 17/12/2018 during night on Satara­Pune road within the vicinity of village Shirval in front of Abhinav Mall. Complaint was lodged on 24/12/2018. There is delay of 7 days in lodging the complaint. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n07. Moreover, it is necessary to mention here that, from the F.I.R. it reveals that, accident had taken place on Satara­Pune road. On the date of incident applicant was driving Shivshahi bus from Vallabhnagar to Chiplun. As per the case of prosecution, accident had taken place on Satara­Pune road in front of Abhinav Mall at Shirwal. Even if it is accepted that, applicant was driving the bus, then he was proceeding from Pune­Satara road and not Satara­Pune road from Pune to Chiplun i.e. from the left side of Pune­Bengalore or Pune­Satara highway. From the F.I.R. it reveals that accident took place on Satara­Pune highway in front of Abhinav Mall, Shirwal. Considering the route of the applicant, I think that, accused was proceeding from Pune­Bengalore road where the dead body of alleged accident was not found. From the case of prosecution, it appears that the dead body of alleged accident was found on Satara­ Pune highway. I am further of the view that, considering the nature of offence, the investigation can be carried out without custodial interrogation and personal interrogation of applicant by police is not necessary. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n08. Considering the nature and seriousness of the offence, keeping in mind that, there is delay in lodging the complaint, keeping in mind the route of applicant on the date of alleged accident, keeping in mind that nothing is necessary to be recovered from the applicant. I am of the view that, this is a fit case in which anticipatory bail can be granted. Hence, I proceed to pass the following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nO R D E R 1. Application is allowed. 2. In the event of arrest of applicant, namely, Prakash Shamrao Burunge in Crime Register No.300 of 2018, of Shirwal Police Station, he be released on furnishing P.R. Bond of Rs.15,000/­ with one surety in like amount. 3. Till filing of the charge­sheet, applicant shall attend the Investigating Officer on every Sunday between 10.00 a.m. to 02.00 noon. 4. The applicant shall neither tamper the evidence of prosecution nor influence the witnesses and assist the Investigating Officer. \r\n---order-ends---\r\nSatara. (N.D.Khose) Date : 02.03.2019. Additional Sessions Judge, Satara."
