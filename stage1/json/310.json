Other arrested accused have informed that this applicant was supplying the material for manufacture of such liquor. 718 liters of adulterated Tadi (liquor) came to be seized during the search and seizure. Sample was sent for analysis and it is revealed that it contains extraneous colour which is harmful for human consumption. The powder which is seized on the spot for manufacture of Tadi is adulterated and not fit for human consumption. In order to burst the racket, custodial interrogation of this applicant is necessary.

  "processedText": "ORDER BELOW EXH.01 IN CRI. BAIL APPLN. NO. 118/2019 MHST01­000611­2019 Kishor Narsaiyya Goud Vs. State of Maharashtra \r\n---header-ends---\r\nThis is an application for anticipatory bail as per section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. \r\n---background-ends---\r\nHeard advocate Mr. Phadtare for applicant. He submitted that Crime No.30/2019 is registered against this applicant with Satara Taluka Police Station for the offences punishable under sections 328 etc. But the applicant has not committed any offence. He is innocent. He is falsely implicated by the accused who are already arrested by the police and released on bail. Applicant is local resident. He has no antecedents. He is the sole earning member in the family. If he is arrested and kept behind the bars, then he would suffer an irreparable loss. His reputation would be maligned. He is ready to obey with all the conditions those may be imposed upon him. Therefore he submitted that by imposing certain conditions, applicant may be released on anticipatory bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n2. APP Mr. Oak by filing say at Exh.7 strongly resisted the application. He replied that alleged offences are in respect of keeping illegal stock of adulterated Tadi (liquor) for the purpose of sale. Applicant and remaining accused have manufactured the same and it was stocked in the house of accused No.5. It is transpired in the investigation that applicant is from Andhra Pradesh State. Other arrested accused have informed that this applicant was supplying the material for manufacture of such liquor. 718 liters of adulterated Tadi (liquor) came to be seized during the search and seizure. Sample was sent for analysis and it is revealed that it contains extraneous colour which is harmful for human consumption. The powder which is seized on the spot for manufacture of Tadi is adulterated and not fit for human consumption. In order to burst the racket, custodial interrogation of this applicant is necessary. Alleged offences are anti­social. On all these grounds, he submitted that application may be rejected. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3. In reply, advocate Mr. Phadtare by inviting my attention to the ADHAR Card, ration card etc. submitted that applicant is local resident and he has no concern with the alleged offences. He was not apprehended on the spot. Therefore he prayed for pre­arrest protection to this applicant. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4. After going through the FIR lodged by informant, it is seen that at the time of search and raid, in the powder being used for manufacture of Tadi which came to be seized, the chemical analysis revealed that there is presence of extraneous colour in that powder which is unsafe and not suitable for human consumption. Alleged offences are anti­social in nature. During custodial interrogation with other arrested accused, role of this applicant is transpired. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5. It is true that he was not apprehended on the spot, but the investigation revealed about his conscious hand in the commission of the alleged offences which are anti­social in nature. For that purpose, custodial interrogation of this applicant is warranted to burst the racket, if any dealing in such illegal business. Accused who are arrested and the present applicant originally hail from Andhra Pradesh. But they are carrying on such business at the village Shendre, Taluka – Satara. Taking into consideration the nature and seriousness of accusation and gravity of offences, it would not be just and safe to release this applicant on anticipatory bail. If such bail is granted to applicant then entire investigation would be paralyzed. Hence the order follows :­ \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER Application is rejected. (Order is dictated and pronounced in the open Court) \r\n---order-ends---\r\nSatara (R.D.Deshpande) Dt.08/03/2019. Additional Sessions Judge, Satara."
