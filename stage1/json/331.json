  "processedText": "ORDER BELOW EXH.01 IN CRI. BAIL APPLN. NO. 143/2019 Shri. Bhaskar Sambhaji Jangam etc.3 Vs. State of Maharashtra \r\n---header-ends---\r\nThis is an application for regular bail as per section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Heard advocate Mr. Maner for applicants. He submitted that in Crime No.14/2019 registered with Mahabaleshwar Police Station for the offences punishable under sections 306, 498­A read with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, both the applicants were arrested on 24/02/2019. They were remanded in police custody till 26/02/2019 and since then they are in Magisterial custody. \r\n---background-ends---\r\nBoth the applicants are innocent. Allegations levelled against them are false and concocted. Applicant No.1 is government servant and applicant No.2 is senior citizen of 65 years of age. They have already undergone custodial interrogation. Their further presence is no more required by the police. If they are kept behind the bars then they would suffer an irreparable loss. They are ready to obey with all the conditions those may be imposed upon them including ban on their entry in Pratapgad. Therefore he submitted that by imposing certain conditions, applicants may be released on bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n2. APP Mrs. Diwakar by filing her say at Exh.4 strongly resisted the application. She submitted that alleged offences are serious. Both these applicants by sharing common intention with the husband of deceased, subjected her to cruelty by name­calling her, by insulting and teasing her on flimsy grounds. She could not tolerate the ill­treatment. Therefore she committed suicide by hanging from the roof. Investigation is in progress. If applicants are released on bail then they are likely to pressurize the informant and witnesses. Therefore she submitted that application may be rejected. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3. With the permission of this Court, informant i.e. father of deceased has filed his affidavit at Exh.7 stating that if applicants are released on bail then there is danger to his life and his family members. Applicants would not co­operate with the investigation. His sister is residing in the same village. Applicants are likely to pressurize her. Therefore bail may not be granted to these applicants. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4. After going through the FIR lodged by the father of deceased, it is seen that so far as allegations against these two applicants are concerned, those are general in nature that both of them used to name­call the deceased by tormenting her by saying that she did not match with her husband. They were already arrested by the police on 24/02/2019 and they have undergone custodial interrogation for two days. Thereafter and as prayed by the police, they are in Magisterial custody. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5. Informant is residing at Pratapgad, Taluka – Mahabaleshwar while these applicants are residents of village Taldeo, Taluka – Mahabaleshwar. Applicant No.1 is Primary Teacher and applicant No.2 is 65 years of age. As such she is senior citizen. There is no propriety in keeping these applicants behind the bars for an inordinate period especially when the allegations against them are general in nature. There is nothing which is to be seized from them. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6. The only grievance of informant is that if these applicants are released on bail then they are likely to pressurize him and the witnesses including his sister who is residing in the village of applicants i.e. Taldeo. If some stringent conditions are imposed then it would serve the purpose of prosecution. When applicants have undergone custodial interrogation, merely for the purpose of pending investigation, they cannot be detained behind the bars for an inordinate period. Applicant No.1 is school teacher and applicant No.2 is senior citizen. Therefore there are no chances of their absconding. As such both of them deserve to be released on bail subject to certain conditions. Hence the order follows :­ \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER 1 Application is allowed. 2 In Crime No. 14/2019 registered with Mahabaleshwar Police Station for the offences punishable under sections 498­A, 306 read with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, applicant No.1 Bhaskar Sambhaji Jangam and applicant No.2 Sou. Laxmi Sambhaji Jangam, be released on bail upon their executing P.R. Bonds of Rs.15,000/­ (Rs. Fifteen thousands) 4/4 Criminal Bail Application No. 143/2019 by each with one surety in the like amount by each on following conditions : i) that they shall attend Mahabaleshwar Police Station on every Sunday in between 11.00 a.m. to 1.00 p.m. till filing of the charge­sheet. ii) that they shall not directly or indirectly, make any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the accusation against him so as to dissuade him from disclosing such facts to the Court or to any police officer. iii) that they shall not tamper with the evidence of prosecution in any manner. iv. that they shall not enter Pratapgad, Taluka – Mahabaleshwar till completion of investigation and they shall not make contact, in any manner with the informant and witnesses including sister of informant namely Sulochana Jangam who is residing in their village. 3 Failure to obey any of the conditions above, would be liable to cancellation of bail granted to applicant. 4 Bail before the lower Court. (Order is dictated and pronounced in the open Court). \r\n---order-ends---\r\nSatara (R.D.Deshpande) Dt. 05/03/2019. Additional Sessions Judge, Satara."
