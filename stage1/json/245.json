State of Maharashtra) CNR : MHST01-000267-2019 \r\n---header-ends---\r\n1) Present application is filed by the applicants under section 439 of Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 on their arrest as a result of complaint dated 17.01.2019 filed by Sagar Ashok Shende, suspecting applicants\u0027 involvement in the C.R.No. 54/2019 for the offence pun/u/S. 307, 364, 392, 397, 298, 452, 143, 147, 149, 427, 510, 323 and u/Sec. 3/25, 30 of Arms Act. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2) Applicants were arrested in above mentioned crime on 18.01.2018, they are in Magisterial Custody from 23.01.2019. It is stated that, applicants were falsely implicated in the present case, they have not committed the alleged offence, they are victims at the hands of informant. It is further contended that, applicants are permanent resident on the given address and they are innocent. It is further contended that, they undertake to make themselves available for interrogation by police as and when required, hence, prayed for releasing them on bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3) The prosecution has filed its say at Exh.5 and resisted the application on the grounds that, applicants and their associates have damaged the car of informant and upon his questioning, after some hot exchange of words there was assault on the informant and his brother and caused injuries to them. It is contended that, applicant no.1 and one of his associate used rifle to threaten the informant and witness. It is contended that, there were 8 to 10 culprits, weapons and vehicles used in commission of crime are to be seized. Hence, prayed for rejection of the application. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4) Advocate for applicants argued that, applicants are innocent persons, having no connection with alleged offence and falsely involved in this crime. It is further argued that, applicants are the only earning members of family and if they remained in jail, their family will be spoiled. It is further contended that, the son of applicant no.1 who is one of the accused in present crime has sustained serious injuries, however, police did not take action. Applicants have no criminal background, they will co­operate with the investigation machinery and will abide every condition imposed by the Court. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5) The accusation against the accused is in respect of the offence pun/u/S. 307, 364, 392, 397, 298, 452, 143, 147, 149, 427, 510, 323 and u/Sec. 3/25, 30 of Arms Act. Allegations are that the accused Ashok Bhise has pointed the gun. Investigation papers are not disclosing about the seizure of gun. FIR is disclosing that Section 364 is mentioned, however, contents in FIR and statements are disclosing that the informant and others were taken to police station by the accused persons. In fact, one of the sons of accused no.1 is injured seriously. They made contact with police, even the police referred him to government hospital but it seems that, no further action is taken by the police. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6) It is submitted on behalf of accused that, the informant\u0027s father has assaulted the son of accused who has filed another application seeking anticipatory bail. Instead of arresting the informant and others, police arrested the applicant no. 1 and 2 and could not make arrest of other two sons of accused no.1 as they got pre­arrest bail. It is pointed out that, applicant no.1 and 2 were in police custody for three days. There was sufficient time to make interrogation with the applicants accused, hence, I am of the view that, accused are not required further more for the purpose of investigation. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n7) Considering the submissions and the facts and the allegations made against the accused, accused may be granted bail by imposing conditions. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER 1) Application Exh. 1 is granted. 2) Applicant no.1 Ashok Dnyandeo Bhise and applicant no.2 Amar Ashok Bhise be released bail on their furnishing personal bond of Rs.25,000/­ (Rs. Twenty Five Thousand) each, with one or more surety/ies, till filing of charge­sheet on following terms \u0026 conditions : a) Both the applicants shall attend the concern police station thrice in a week on every Monday, Wednesday and Saturday in between 11:00 a.m. to 1.00 p.m. b) Applicants shall not directly or indirectly make any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the case so as to dissuade him from disclosing such facts to the court or to any Police Officer. c) Applicants shall make available himself and co­ operate for interrogation by Police Officer as and when required and shall co­operate in the investigation of the present C.R. d) Applicants shall not tamper any of the documents connected to the present C.R. under investigation. e) Applicants shall also produce the documents called by the I.O. during the course of investigation. f) Applicants shall not leave Satara City without prior permission of the I.O. g) Bail in Trial Court. \r\n---order-ends---\r\n(B.S.Wavre) Place : Satara Addl.
