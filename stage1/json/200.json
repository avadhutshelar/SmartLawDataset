Bail Application No.280/2019 :- \r\n---header-ends---\r\nThis is an application for grant of ad interim anticipatory bail under section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, for the offence punishable under sections 306 read with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code in crime No. 13/19 registered with Sinhagad Road police station, Pune. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2] The prosecution case in short is that the accused persons have abetted deceased Rohini Deepak Shirsat to commit suicide. Deceased is wife of accused No.1. The deceased came to know that accused No.1 is going to marry with accused No.2. Accused No.1 illtreated deceased physically and mentally and due to that, the deceased has committed suicide. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3] Heard Advocate Shri. Patil for the applicant. Perused documentary evidence placed on record. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4] The learned counsel of applicant vehemently argued that the present accused has not committed any offence as alleged and she has been falsely implicated on suspicion. There is no iota of evidence against the applicant. The custody of the applicant is not at all required for investigation. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5] It is specifically argued by learned counsel of applicant that she is innocent and she has not committed any offence as alleged and therefore she is entitled for the relief of ad interim anticipatory bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6] On perusal of the copy of F.I.R., it appears that the complainant has made specific allegations that present applicant and husband of deceased. There were illicit relations between the present applicant and husband of deceased i.e. accused No.1. Accused No.1 was illtreating deceased on that count. Prima facie involvement of the applicant in the offence in question appears. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n7] Considering the allegations made in the F.I.R. and considering the gravity of the offence, it cannot be said that custodial interrogation of the applicant is not necessary. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n8] Considering these facts together, considering the allegations made in the F.I.R. and considering the nature and gravity of the offences alleged to have been committed by the applicant, I am of the view that this is not a fit case to grant ad interim anticipatory bail to the applicant. Hence, the following order :- \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER The application is rejected. \r\n---order-ends---\r\n( Mrs. M.M. Deshpande) Date: 17-1-2019. Additional Sessions Judge, Pune.
