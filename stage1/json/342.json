  "processedText": "ORDER BELOW EXH.01 IN CRI. BAIL APPLN. NO. 157/2019 Shashikant Yallappa Desai Vs. State of Maharashtra \r\n---header-ends---\r\nThis is an application for regular bail as per section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Heard advocate Mr. Ghadage for applicant. He submitted that Crime No.62/2019 is registered against applicant with Satara Taluka Police Station for the offence punishable under section 370(3) of the Indian Penal Code so also under sections 3, 4, 5 and 7 of the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956. Applicant is behind the bars since 27/02/2019. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2. He also submitted that applicant is falsely implicated by some women at the instance of police. He is respectable person in the society and running a Lodge namely Dhanashree Hotel and Lodging on national highway No.4 within the limits of village Limb, Taluka – Satara. He has already undergone custodial interrogation and his further presence is no more required by the police. He is local resident and is ready to obey with all the conditions those may be imposed upon him. Therefore he submitted that by imposing certain conditions, applicant may be released on bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3. APP Mr. Oak by filing his say at Exh.6 strongly resisted the application. He submitted that this applicant was found living on the earnings of prostitution by employing the prostitutes in his lodge and accepting half of the amount from their earnings. If applicant is released on bail then he is likely to continue with the same activities. Alleged offences are anti­social in nature. Therefore he submitted that application may be rejected. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4. In the alternative, he submitted that if this Court comes to the conclusion that applicant deserves for bail then he may be directed to furnish undertaking that in future he would not indulge in such activities. Since applicant is behind the bars, advocate Mr. D. S. Ghadage has furnished undertaking of wife of applicant with the same contents and has undertaken to furnish the undertaking of applicant within 8 days from his release on bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5. In view of above­said facts and circumstances, applicant deserves to be released on bail. He is local resident. If he is kept behind the bars then he would suffer a lot in his business as well as in his family life. He has already undergone custodial interrogation. Nothing is remained to be seized at his instance as the remand report discloses that the relevant documents and other articles are already seized by the police. If some conditions are imposed including furnishing of undertaking by applicant then it would serve the purpose of prosecution. Hence the order follows :­ \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER 1 Application is allowed. 2 In Crime No. 62/2019 registered with Satara Taluka Police Station for the offence punishable under section 370(3) of the Indian Penal Code so also under sections 3, 4, 5 and 7 of the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956, applicant Shashikant Yallappa Desai, be released on bail upon his executing P.
