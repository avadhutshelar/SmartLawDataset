State of Maharashtra) CNR : MHST01­000500­2019 \r\n---header-ends---\r\n1) Present bail application is preferred by the applicants under section 439 of Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 seeking their release from having being arrested under execution of non bailable warrants issued in R.C.C. no. 46/2015. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2) It is contended by applicant\u0027s advocate that, accused are arrested under execution of NBW at the time the accused\u0027s preferred application for cancellation of the said warrants. It is contended that, the offences charged are bailable in nature and triable by J.M.F.C. Court. It is further contended that, accused are present in the Court and were informed of the next date of hearing as 31/01/2019. However, due to miscommunication, accused could not attend the said date of hearing and NBW came to be issued against the accused on 31/01/2019. Accused preferred bail application on 07/02/2019 and are arrested immediately. It is contended that, accused undertakes to attend every date of hearing expedite the trial. Accordingly, bail is contended. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3) Bail application is resisted by the APP by filing say at Exh. 4 on the grounds that, accused are arrested in breach of conditions as per section 436(2) of Criminal Procedure Code, 1973, hence are not entitled for bail. It is contended that, in case of released on bail, they may abscond and protract the trial. Accordingly, bail is resisted. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4) Upon hearing the APP and applicant\u0027s advocate and perusing the papers, it appears that, applicants/accused are arrested under execution of NBW issued by Ld. JMFC Khandala. Perusal of the record revealed that there are about 18 or more accused. In such circumstances, it is uncertain as to which of the accused has been instrumental in protracting the trial. In such circumstances, keeping the accused arrested pending the trial, would amount to punishment before trial, which is not justifiable. At the same time, APP\u0027s apprehensions shall also have to be considered for ensuring accused\u0027s presence at the hearing and facing the trial. The same can be secured by subjecting the accused to certain conditions. Hence, the following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nO R D E R 1) Criminal Bail Application no. 99/2018, is allowed; 2) Applicant no. 1 Chiral Namdev Chavan, no. 2 Kiran Sadashiv Mane, no. 3 Shubham Ashok Taru, no. 4 Alpesh Vasudev Taru, no. 5 Kunal @ Kishor Prakash Wadekar, no. 6 Dilip Maruti Wadekar, no. 7 Ashish Pramod Doifode, no. 8 Sachin Sopan Pansare, no. 9 Narendra Prabhakar Godbole and no. 10 Ajay Ramdas Chouthe, be released from arrest under execution of NBW issued in R.C.C. no. 46/2015 upon paying penalty of Rs. 2,000/­ each (Rs.Two Thousand Hundred each); and executing personal bond of Rs.25,000/­ each (Rs. Twenty Five Thousand) with atleast one or more local surety/ies, to make up the bail amount; on following terms \u0026 conditions; a) Applicants shall not tamper with evidence. b) Applicants shall not directly or indirectly make any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the case so as to dissuade him from disclosing such facts to the court or to any Police Officer. c) Applicants shall attend each and every date of hearing, failing which the bail granted herein shall automatically stand cancelled. \u003d3\u003d d) Applicants shall provide their addresses of availability and operative mobile numbers to the concern police station. Accused shall always be available through their given mobile numbers. e) Compliance before lower Court. \r\n---order-ends---\r\n(Y. H. Ameta) Place : Satara Addl.
