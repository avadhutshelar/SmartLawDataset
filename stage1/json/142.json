Moreover, from the police papers, it reveals that on 16/12/2018, suicide chit was found in the pant pocket of deceased, and same day, police have seized it. Moreover, from the contents of suicide note, it reveals that applicant/accused and other co­accused harassed deceased, on count of their demand of interest on hand loan amount, and also threatened to kill him, therefore, he has committed suicide. Thus from the suicide note, it is crystal clear that as the deceased was harassed and threatened to kill on count of paying interest of hand loan by present applicant/accused, Prakash Jadhav and Netaji Adsul, deceased has committed suicide. Therefore, in such circumstance, at this stage, there is prima facie sufficient evidence to show that applicant/accused has instigated to deceased to commit suicide.

  "processedText": "CNR No.MHPU01­000694­2019 Rohidas Ashok Tekale Vs. State of Maharashtra (Sinhgad Road Police Station ) \r\n---header-ends---\r\nOrder below exh. 1 in Cri. Bail application No.176/2019 1. This is an application U/s.439 of Cr.P.C. filed by the applicant­accused for grant of bail in connection with Crime No.709/2018, registered with Sinhgad Road Police Station for the offence punishable u/s. 306, 506 r/w.s.34 of the Indian Penal Code \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2 Prosecution case is that deceased­Dnyaneshwar Mahamuni had taken loan of Rs. 1 lakh from present applicant accused, Rs.1,50,000/­ from accused Prakash Jadhav, and Rs.50,000/­ from Netaji Adsul, and out of the said amount of Rs.50,000/­ was paid to Prakash Jadhav, in spite of said fact, the accused harassed and threatened him to pay handloan amount with interest and beat him, resulting to which, deceased fed up to life and on 14/12/2018, he committed suicide. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3. Learned counsel for applicant/accused submitted that applicant/accused has not committed any offence, he has been falsely implicated in this offence. He further submitted that only to avoid repayment of hand loan, taken by complainant and her husband, for purchasing flat with an ulterior motive, false complaint is lodged against present applicant/accused. He further submitted that ingredients of section 107 of IPC are not made out from the contents of FIR. He further submitted that there is delay more than 14 days for lodging FIR itself shows that with ulterior motive, offence is register against applicant/accused. He further submitted that custodial interrogation of the applicant/accused is not necessary, therefore, he be released on bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4. On the other hand, learned APP submitted that suicide note was found, in which, deceased specifically stated that applicant/accused and other co­accused harassed him on count of demand of interest on hand loan amount, therefore, he going to commit suicide. He further submitted that after death of deceased mental condition of his family members not good, therefore, delay caused to lodge FIR. He further submitted that the impugned chit was found in pant pocket of deceased, therefore, falsely involving the accused not arises. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5. On perusing police papers, prima facie, it reveals that on 30/12/2018, Radhika Mahamuni – widow of deceased lodged report at Sinhgad road police station, alleging in that the applicant/accused and other co­accused have threatened and harassed her husband on count of refund of hand loan amount with interest, therefore, deceased has committed suicide. Moreover, from the police papers, it reveals that on 16/12/2018, suicide chit was found in the pant pocket of deceased, and same day, police have seized it. Moreover, from the contents of suicide note, it reveals that applicant/accused and other co­accused harassed deceased, on count of their demand of interest on hand loan amount, and also threatened to kill him, therefore, he has committed suicide. Thus from the suicide note, it is crystal clear that as the deceased was harassed and threatened to kill on count of paying interest of hand loan by present applicant/accused, Prakash Jadhav and Netaji Adsul, deceased has committed suicide. Therefore, in such circumstance, at this stage, there is prima facie sufficient evidence to show that applicant/accused has instigated to deceased to commit suicide. Investigation is at very crucial stage, therefore, in my view, applicant is not entitled to be released on bail at this stage. Hence, application deserves to be rejected. Hence, I pass following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER i. Application is rejected. \r\n---order-ends---\r\nDate :­19/01/2019 (K.D.Vadane) Additional Sessions Judge, Pune. 4 “I affirm that the contents of the PDF file Order are same word to word as per original judgment.” Name of Steno : Shri S.
