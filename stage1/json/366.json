State of Maharashtra, Through Incharge of Baramati Taluka Police Station, Tal­Baramati, Dist­Pune. … Opponent \r\n---header-ends---\r\nORDER BELOW BAIL APPLICATION EXH­1 1] The applicant (accused No. 3) has filed present bail application under section 439 of Cr.P.C. for his release on bail in C.R. No. 2/2019, registered with Baramati Taluka Police Station for the offences under section 395, 323, 504, 506 of I.P.C. The applicant/ accused arrested on 3­1­2019 and now he is in judicial custody. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2] The allegation against the applicant and four others are that on 3­1­2019 they have committed dacoity by committing robbery of cash of Rs. 2000/­ from the pocket of the informant, on account that the informant asked them to purchase the cinema tickets and then only to see the cinema where the informant was serving as a duty officer. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3] The applicant stated that he has been falsely implicated. He is ready to abide with any conditions which may be imposed by the court. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4] The application is opposed by Investigating officer and APP on the ground that the looted amount is to be recovered and name of the unknown accused to be revealed. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5] I heard advocate A.T. Waghmode for the applicant and APP 2 Cr.Bail 18/2019 Smt. S.K. Naik for the prosecution. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6] In Criminal Bail Application No. 8/2019 vide order dated 10­ 1­2019 other co­accused are already released on bail by this court. In that matter the informant had appeared and filed his affidavit stating that due to misunderstanding he filed the FIR and there was no commission of dacoity, but there was only minor quarrels. The grounds mentioned in the say by the I.O. that he has to recover remaining amount from other absconding accused and name of absconding accused is to be revealed, are not sufficient grounds to deny the bail to the present applicant. Therefore, I am inclined to allow the application as follows :­ \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER 1] Criminal Bail application No. 18/2019 is allowed. 2] The applicant/accused Rushikesh Vinayak Adagale in C.R.
