State of Maharashtra \r\n---header-ends---\r\nThis is the second application for regular bail as per section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Heard advocate Mr. Jadhav for applicant. He submitted that in Crime No.952/2018 registered with Satara City Police Station for the offences punishable under sections 376 etc. of the Indian Penal Code, applicant is behind the bars since 27/10/2018. \r\n---background-ends---\r\nFirst bail application filed by him bearing No. 912/2018 came to be rejected by this Court mainly on the ground that investigation was in progress and that he is likely to tamper with the evidence of prosecution. But now investigation is completed and charge­sheet is submitted by the police before the Chief Judicial Magistrate bearing RCC No.67/2019. Presence of this applicant is no more required by the police for interrogation. He is ready to obey with all the conditions those may be imposed upon him. Other accused are already released on bail by this Court. Therefore on the ground of parity also, he deserves to be released on bail. Applicant is of young age and wants to take further education. He is also doing the job. There is no propriety in keeping him behind the bars. Therefore he submitted that by imposing certain conditions, applicant may be released on bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n2. APP Mrs. Diwakar by filing her say at Exh.6 strongly resisted the application. She submitted that by giving false promise of marriage, applicant has repeatedly committed rape upon the victim. He also gave threats to make viral the video shoots. Then he abruptly avoided to marry her. Though investigation is completed and charge­sheet is filed by the police, prosecution is ready to conduct the trial expeditiously by filing the draft­charge. If applicant is released on bail then he is likely to pressurize the prosecutrix/informant and witnesses of the prosecution. Therefore she submitted that application may be rejected. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3. First bail application of this applicant bearing Criminal Bail Application No. 912/2018 came to be rejected on 26/11/2018 mainly on the ground that investigation was in progress and applicant was likely to tamper with the evidence of prosecution. But now investigation is completed and charge­sheet is submitted by the police before the CJM, Satara bearing RCC No.67/2019. Applicant is behind the bars since 27/10/2018 i.e. for the period more than four months. Part of his custodial interrogation is already over. Other accused are already released on bail by this Court. Applicant is of young age. He wants to continue his education so also the job. There is no propriety in keeping him behind the bars for an inordinate period. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4. After going through the FIR, it appears that applicant and the prosecutrix/informant were in love with each other and they have stayed together in a rented room. They came in physical contact with each other. Considering the fact that, investigation is completed and prosecutrix was in love with this applicant, if some stringent conditions are imposed then it would serve the purpose of prosecution. Hence the order follows :­ \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER 1 Application is allowed. 2 In Crime No. 952/2018 registered with Satara City Police Station for the offences punishable under sections 376 etc. of the Indian Penal Code, applicant Panchasheel Sharad Kanvalu, be released on bail upon his executing P.R.
