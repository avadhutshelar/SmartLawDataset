Respondent. \r\n---header-ends---\r\nORDER BELOW EXH.1 This is the first bail application filed by the applicant under Section 438 of the Criminal Procedure Code for anticipatory bail in C.R.No.952/2018 registered by Pimpri Police Station under Section 452, 142, 143, 147, 149, 427 of the Indian Penal Code and under section 37, 135 of Maharashtra Police Act. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n[2] Perused the application and say given at Exh.6. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[3] I have heard learned advocate Mr. Navgire for the applicant and Mr. Aurangabadkar for the State. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[4] The learned advocate for the applicant argued that the accused is falsely implicated in the present crime. Three accused were arrested and were sent in police custody, but there was no recovery at their instance. Having regard to the nature of the offence, there is no need of custodial interrogation and the ground put­fourth for rejecting the application is that recovery of the weapon, i.e. wooden log is not made. He submitted that accused are law abiding citizens. There are no criminal antecedents against them. There is no need of custodial interrogation and they are ready to abide any condition if imposed. The arrested accused are already released on bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[3] The learned APP argued that there are direct allegations against the accused. So far as arrested accused are concerned, no recovery is made at their instance. The weapon used in the offence is yet to be recovered. He prayed for rejection of the application. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[4] I have carefully gone through the FIR and the documents of the investigation produced for my perusal. In the FIR, it is specifically alleged that accused / applicant Parshuram Daundkar and another co­accused Ganesh Bhaskar were armed with wooden log / stick and they have caused damage to the Samsung television, Godrej refrigerator and other household articles kept in the house of the informant. It is clear that not only there are specific allegations against the present applicant, but the accused / applicant and other accused have taken the law in their hand. They committed criminal trespass with intention to cause damage to the property of the informant. Having regard to the nature of the offence, the role attributed to the applicant / accused in the FIR, I find that this is not a fit case where anticipatory bail can be granted to the applicant / accused. Hence, I pass the following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER The bail application is rejected. \r\n---order-ends---\r\nPune, Dated/­19­01­2019 ( Aniruddha Y.
