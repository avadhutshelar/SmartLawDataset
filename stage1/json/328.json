Applicant, namely, Kalyan Dadaso Gawade by this application under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure pray for bail in C.R.No.563 of 2018 registered with Phaltan Rural Police Station under Sections 307, 326, r/w.34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 and under Section 3, 25 and 27 of the Arms Act. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n02. Perused the application and say filed by the prosecution at Exh.4. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n03. According to the applicant, Police has falsely implicated him. Applicant is permanent resident of village Barad, Tal. Phaltan. Applicant came from respectable and reputed family. The applicant and complainant are having civil dispute. Applicant has lodged complaint at Phaltan Taluka Police Station, however cognizance was not taken by Police. Name of applicant is not mentioned in F.I.R. Applicant will not misuse his liberty if he is released on bail. Applicant prayed to allow the application. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n04. From the say of learned A.P.P. at Exh.4, it reveals that, applicant has given contract of Rs.10 Lacs to contract killer i.e. accused No.2 and 3 through Vinayak Khomane. Advance of Rs. One Lac was also given through Vinayak Khomane. Applicant and informant are resident of same village. As such there is apprehension to the life of informant at the hands of applicant. Learned A.P.P. prayed to reject the application. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n05. Heard learned Advocate for the applicant and learned A.P.P. It is vehemently argued by the learned Advocate for the applicant that, accused No.1 is released on bail by the Hon\u0027ble High Court, Bombay. Later on names of accused No.2 to 6 were revealed in investigation. Applicant is falsely involved in the present offence. Learned Advocate for the applicant prayed to allow the application. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n06. Per contra, it is vehemently argued by learned A.P.P. that, there is civil dispute between applicant and informant and applicant has given contract of Rs.10 Lacs to contract killers accused No.2 and 3 through Vinayak Khomane and advance of Rs.One Lac was given through Vinayak Khomane. If applicant is released on bail, possibility of commission of another offence cannot be ruled out. Learned A.P.P. prayed to reject the application. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n07. I have gone through the complaint. From the complaint of Gulab Uttam Bhandalkar dated 28/12/2018, it reveals that, there are indifferences between complainant, Dayanand Sadashiv Gawade, Vijay Sadashiv Gawade on account of election. There are complaints between them on account of election. On 28.12.2018, at about 05.00 to 06.00 p.m., when complainant was proceeding from Barad–Gunavare road and was near Meeravali Peer, he saw accused No.1 and some unknown persons came from back side of accused No.1 and fired from the back side of complainant by saying that, why complainant is troubling Gawade Saheb. F.I.R. indicates the same story. From the statement of complainant dated 29.12.2018, it reveals that, accused No.1 and two unknown persons came on motorcycle from back side of complainant. Accused No.1 was on one motorcycle and unknown persons were on another motorcycle. Accused No.1 was stating unknown persons that, Gawade Saheb told to assault the complainant and said fact was listened by the complainant. The description of unknown assailants was mentioned in statement dated 29.12.2018. From the statement of Deepak Tembre dated 29.12.2018, it reveals that, on 28.12.2018 from 06.30 a.m., Deepak was in his hotel. At about 05.15 p.m. accused No.1 came to him on his motorcycle and they were discussing in respect of agricultural land. From the statement of Vaishnavi, it reveals that, accused No.1 went to Barad on his motorcycle after sending her at house. From the statement of Prakash Tatyaba Jadhav, dated 30.12.2018, it reveals that, complainant told Prakash that, the persons of Gawade Saheb opened fire on him. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n08. From the remand report dated 20/02/2019, it reveals that, earlier P.C.R. was granted to applicant and on 20/02/2019 M.C.R. was granted. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n09. True that, bail application of accused No.1 bearing No.6/2019 was rejected by this Court. Further true that, Hon\u0027ble High Court, Bombay granted bail to accused No.1 by name Vijay Sadashiv Gawade on 11/02/2019. However, it is necessary to mention here that, on the basis of submission of learned A.P.P. before Hon\u0027ble High Court, Bombay that, there are other four accused arrested in crime where from it revealed that, accused No.1 has not played any active role in the crime in question. That being so, case for grant of bail is made out. On the basis of submission of learned A.P.P. before Hon\u0027ble High Court and as no active role was played by accused No.1, he was released on bail by Hon\u0027ble High Court, Bombay on 11/02/2019 in Cri. Bail Appln. No.216/2019. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n10. In the case at hand, allegations levelled against applicant are, he has given contract of Rs.10 Lacs to contract killer accused No.2 and 3 through Vinayak Khomane and amount of Rs.One Lac was paid as advance amount through Vinayak Khomane. From the contents of application, it reveals that, there is civil dispute between present applicant and informant. From the say of learned A.P.P. and Police papers, it reveals that, applicant has given contract of Rs.10 Lacs to contract killer accused No.2 and 3 through Vinayak Khomane and also paid advance amount of Rs.One Lac through Vinayak Khomane. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n11. In my mind, investigation is in progress, charge­sheet is not yet filed. The alleged offence is serious in nature and if applicant is released on bail, the possibility cannot be ruled out that, he will misuse his liberty. Considering the nature of offence, considering the role played by applicant in alleged offence, I am of the view that, prima facie no case is made out by applicant to release him on bail. Hence, I proceed to pass the following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER Cri. Bail Appln. No.140/2019 is hereby rejected. \r\n---order-ends---\r\nSatara. Date : 17.04.2019. (N.D.Khose) Additional Sessions Judge, Satara."
