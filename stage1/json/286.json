State of Maharashtra) CNR : MHST01­000487­2019 \r\n---header-ends---\r\n1) Present application is filed by the applicant Surekha Virchand Metha, under section 438 of Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 apprehending her arrest, under C.R. no. 48/2019, registered at Phaltan city police station, at the instance of Smt. Bhagyashri Kamalakar Bhat, for alleged commission of offences punishable under sections 406, 409 \u0026 420 r/w. 34 of Indian Penal Code, 1860 and hence has approached Court seeking pre­arrest bail. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2) Advocate for applicant argued that, FIR dated 31/01/2019 is not maintainable at all and has been illegally and irregularly recorded inspite of there being an previous statement dated 16/11/2018 to the police in reference of same incidence. It is contended that, statement dated 16/11/2018 ought to be the FIR and there had arisen no circumstances for recording the FIR after about delay of 2½ months. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3) It is contended that, Audit Report for accounting year ending on 31/03/2018, as submitted by M/s. Nazare and Belhe, shows 1008, Chintamani Parshavnath Gramin Bigar Sheti Sahakari Patasanstha Maryadit, Kolki, Tal. Phaltan, Dist. Satara, to be in financial crisis. Present applicant is the members of Board of Directors of that Co­operative Society. Present applicant is aged about 67 years. She does not participate in day to day activities of the Society. She is member of the Board of Director as a female member is mandatorily required in the Board of Directors. She has maintained fixed deposit of about Rs. 12,00,000/­ with this Society. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4) It is contended that, in no circumstances could a financial crisis attract any FIR, as elements of being in financial \u003d2\u003d crisis are different than that of intention to cheat or defraud the depositors. It in no circumstances could be considered to be a criminal offence. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5) It is contended that, the informant\u0027s complaint being that her deposit amounts not being returned, the only remedy he could have, was of either preferring recovery proceedings in the Co­operative Court or to lodge a complaint before the Consumer Forum, as it is a matter of mere breach of contract and nothing more. Complainant having lodged complaint before the Consumer Forum, lodging the FIR was illegal on the part of informant. It is also contended that, complaint filed before the Consumer Forum is also premature as informant\u0027s some of fixed deposits are yet to mature in July, 2019 and even in September, 2019. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6) It is contended that, Audit­report does not reveal any incriminating element against this applicant or any of the member of Board of Director of Society, inspite of classifying the Society in \u0027D\u0027 Category. Audit report does not contain any findings or allegations against this applicant of having either misappropriated or misused the Society\u0027s funds. It is contended that, there are no allegations that loans are advanced to the Director\u0027s relatives. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n7) It is contended that, in case of financial crisis of Co­ operative Society, action could have been initiated under sections 81 to 88 of the Maharashtra Co­operative Societies Act. In case of any misfeasance in Society\u0027s funds, as per section 82 of the Maharashtra Co­operative Societies Act, Auditor ought to be the complainant, however audit report does not bear any allegations against applicant and even Auditor has not lodged any complaint. In such circumstances, the informant being a mere depositor could not have any locus to lodge present FIR. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n8) It is contended that, at the instance of informant, \u003d3\u003d Advocate Borate had issued notice dated 22/11/2018 to the applicant. The purport of notice was initiating proceeding before Consumer Forum. In such circumstances, present FIR could not have been lodged. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n9) It is also contended that, as per definition of financial, institutions under section 2(d) of the Maharashtra Protection of Interest of Depositors (In Financial Establishments) Act, 1999 (In short “MPID Act”), present Co­operative Society, does not gets covered thereunder, hence no offence under section 3 \u0026 4 of the MPID Act, could be registered against this applicant, as this applicant never harboured any fraudulent intention to cheat or defraud the depositors. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n10) It is also contended that, the amounts could not be repaid to the depositor/informant, as the society is in financial crisis, but applicant not having any intention cheat any depositors. Offences under section Indian Penal Code, also cannot be attracted. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n11) It is also contended that, as this applicant has also maintained deposits with the same Co­operative Society. In such circumstances, this applicant Director cannot mismanage or misappropriate the Society fund. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n12) It is also contended that, Co­operative Societies all the accounts and record books are attached and seized by the police, therefore, no element of seizure or recovery remains to be done by this applicant. Allegations being of non payment of deposit amounts, same could be vouched by the account books and documents, hence applicant\u0027s custodial interrogation is not required. Accordingly, pre­arrest bail is contended. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n13) Applicant\u0027s advocate has placed reliance on Gurbaksh Singh Sibbia Vs. the State of Punjab AIR 1980 Supreme Court 1632. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n14) Bail application is resisted by the APP by filing say at Exh. 12 on the grounds that, applicant being Director and Trustee of the Co­operative Society is responsible to look after and take care of financial activities of the Society. Co­operative Society floating many schemes accepted terms deposits and fixed deposits by inducement of lucrative rate of interest. It is contended that, besides informant, many other persons had maintained deposits with the Society. Informant had invested total amount of Rs.9,09,209/­ with the Society. Upon maturity of deposit amounts, inspite of repeated demands, amounts were not paid to the informant. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n15) Informant had persistently requested the Chairman Kothari and other Directors for repayment of money. Informant was provided with cheques, however said cheques got dishonoured. As the amounts have not been repaid, complaints were even lodged to the Assist. Registrar Co­operative Societies, who in turn had directed the office bearers of Society to repay the amounts, however said amounts were not repaid and informant\u0027s inquiries were avoided on one pretext or the other. Therefore, informant has lodged present FIR. Informant has also initiated proceeding before the Consumer Forum seeking recovery of amounts. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n16) The Board of Director of the Society called the depositors meeting on 22/10/2018 and therein gave assurance of repaying the amounts, but actually did not repay the amounts and thereby element of cheating and fraud has arisen. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n17) It is also contended that, none of the deposit receipts carried a condition of barring premature surrender of the deposits. Therefore, even if deposits could have been demanded backprematurely, the Society was obliged to make payments of amounts. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n18) It is contended that, even if documents are seized, amounts are yet to be recovered. Informant\u0027s and other depositors\u0027 amounts are yet not returned. Custodial investigation is required to cull out the modus of leading the Society in financial crisis and also for tracing appropriation of the Society\u0027s funds. Accordingly, pre­arrest bail is resisted. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n19) Upon perusing the FIR, hearing the applicant\u0027s advocate and the APP, it appears that, the informant is a depositor with said Society of which applicant is a member of Board of Directors. Society deals in accepting deposits and lending loan. Audit report reveals the Society to be classified in \u0027D\u0027 category i.e. being a financial crisis. Undisputedly, management would be responsible for ensuring smooth cash flow and availabilities of funds for repaying the deposit amounts, upon it\u0027s maturity or even on premature surrender. It is also undisputed that, the depositors have alternate recourses before the Co­operative or the Consumer Forums. However, the fact that the members of Board of Directors calling meetings of depositors and time and again giving assurances of repaying the amounts, issuing cheques in respect of it and cheques getting dishounoured, inaction at the part of the managing committee to ensure the honouring of cheques or repayments of amounts has resulted into the FIR. It becomes a matter of investigation about the reasons of disparity in the cash flow of Society\u0027s funds. It is further surprising that, Auditor\u0027s report merely \u0027D\u0027 classified the Society, however the reasons of financial crisis is not forming part of the report. The reasons of financial crisis, the appropriation of funds are matter of thorough investigation. There are similar complaints of the other depositors also. Another FIR is also lodged against applicant for non refund of Rs. 1,33,62,201/­ of another depositor having lodged another C.R. no. 47/2019. In such circumstances, it appears that, many depositors are helplessly waiting for collecting back their amounts from the Society, but to no avail. In such circumstances, it appears the matter to be of thorough investigation about the actual application of amounts and it\u0027s recoveries. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n20) The contentions about provisions of sections 3 \u0026 4 of MPID Act, whether attracted or not, whether the present society gets covered under the definition of financial institution, as mentioned in the MPID Act, are the issues to be considered at trial or arguments thereafter. Thus, it appears that, the applicant has not made out any case for grant of pre­arrest bail. Hence, the following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER Criminal Bail Application no. 94/2019, is rejected. \r\n---order-ends---\r\n(Y. H. Ameta) Place : Satara Addl. Sessions Judge Date : 08th March, 2019. Satara"
