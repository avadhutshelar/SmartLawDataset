(Presided over by S.T.Bhalerao, Addl.Sessions Judge) Criminal Bail Application No. : 13 of 2019 . (CNR NO. : MHPU14­000054­2019) Applicant : Yunus Rahim Pathan // VERSUS // Non­applicant : 1] State of Maharashtra Through Police Station Officer, Police Station Indapur, District Pune. \r\n---header-ends---\r\nORDER BELOW EXHIBIT 1. ( Passed on this 18th January, 2019 ) This is second application for grant of bail in Crime No. 49/2018 under Sections 353,395,307,379,504,506 of the Indian Penal Code registered at Police Station Indapur, Dist. Pune filed under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2] It is contended that there is delay of 12 hrs. for lodging F.I.R. Prima facie allegations for above mentioned offences are not made out against the accused. The investigation has been completed and charge sheet has been presented before JMFC Indapur. He is an innocent person. There is no direct or indirect evidence against him. He is the only earning member in the family. He is ready to co­operate in the investigation. He is permanent resident of above mentioned address. He is ready to abide by all the conditions. It is prayed to allow the application. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3] The Investigation Officer and the learned A.P.P. opposed the application by filing say at Exh.5. It is submitted that this accused is the Cri.Bail Appln. No. 13/2019 2 Yunus Pathan main perpetrator of the crime. This accused tried to kill the Government servants by jumping out of the truck, which he himself drove and the informant and witnesses were in the truck. The motorcycle came to be seized from other accused. The truck was also came to be seized along with the sand loaded therein. The accused is recidivist. The chargesheet has been presented against this accused in this matter. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4] Another crime being crime no. 160/2018 punishable under Sections 384, 341, 324, 323, 504, 506, 147, 148 of I.P.C. has been registered against him at Walchandnagar police station. If the accused is released on bail, he can bring pressure on the informant and witnesses. It is submitted to reject the application. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5] Heard both the sides and perused the copy of charge sheet produced for perusal. The learned Advocate for the accused submitted that the application made for anticipatory bail made before the Hon\u0027ble High Court had been rejected. Thereafter, application for regular bail came to be preferred, which also came to be rejected by this Court. It is submitted that other accused have been released on bail by the order of this Court and Hon\u0027ble High Court, respectively. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6] Learned A.P.P. reiterated the contentions made in the say Exh.5. It is further submitted that this accused is the main perpetrator of the crime. His role is much graver than that of the other accused, who came to be released by Hon\u0027ble High Court and by predecessor in office of this P.O., respectively. It is submitted that though the charge sheet has been presented, looking grave role of the accused, he is not entitled to be released on bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n7] It is seen that looking to the role of this accused, which is much graver than the role of other accused, he is not entitled to the parity. A perusal of copy of chargesheet shows that the name of accused is mentioned in the F.I.R., and there is prima facie material against the accused in respect of the alleged crime. As per the report, the life of Government servants on duty was put into danger by the accused. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n8] There is one more crime registered against the accused, while he was on interim bail granted by the Hon\u0027ble Bombay High Court in Cri. Bail application no. 641/2018 in Yunus Rahim Khan Vs. State of Maharashtra order dt. 31/10/2018. That offence is also of serious nature. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n9] It is seen that the material available on record prima facie show that the accused was involved in illegal excavation and transport of sand. So also he put the life of public officer in danger by jumping from a truck in motion and without stopping the truck. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n10] The gravity of the offence is much serious. The incidents like running over the vehicles on Revenue Officers and police officers with intention to kill them, who try to stop illegal activities have been increasing at an alarming rate. The illegal excavation of minerals jeopardize the environment and also Govt. exchequer. Here, an attempt to kill Govt. officers is also there. No doubt, the chargesheet has been presented.
