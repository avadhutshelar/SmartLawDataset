It is further contended that, applicant is senior citizen and suffering from high blood pressure, he has no criminal background, he is ready to abide all the conditions imposed while allowing the application. Hence, prayed for bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4) Prosecution submitted its say at Exh.5 and contended that, informant is Police Patil of the village where applicant resides, other witnesses are also from the same village.
