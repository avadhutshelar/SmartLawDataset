State of Maharashtra) CNR : MHST01­000836­2018 \r\n---header-ends---\r\n1) Present application is filed by the applicant Imran Harun Bagwan, under section 439 of Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 seeking his release from arrest under C.R. no. 17/2019, registered at Borgaon police station, on 25/01/2019 at the instance of Omkar Sanjay Jadhav, for alleged commission of offences punishable under sections 306 and 506 of Indian Penal Code, 1860. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2) Advocate for applicant\u0027s contended that, present accused is falsely implicated in the offence without having any concern with the death or suicide of the informant\u0027s sister. It is also contended that, it is a disputed fact whether the accused was in love affair with the informant\u0027s sister or not. It is further contended that, even if the factum of affair is to be accepted, further if the accused\u0027s conversation and exchange of messages through mobile with the informant\u0027s sister are accepted that itself cannot attribute any reason or intention for the accused to abate the suicide. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3) It is further contended that, reasons of the informant\u0027s sister being unhappy after phone conversations, are not borne out in the FIR and that per­se cannot be contended as abatement of suicide. It is further contended that, prior to this FIR, there has been no complaint by either the informant or his mother against this accused. Even the deceased had never complained anything against the accused. Therefore also, FIR is contended to be false. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4) Accused advocate contended that, accused is a young boy about 24 to 25 years having shop in the heart of Satara city, therefore he may not abscond, shall co­operate in the investigation. Accused\u0027s mobile, SIM­card and Memory­card are already sized therefore there is no element of seizure or recovery to be done from him. Hence also, his custodial presence is not required. Accused has in support of his arguments placed on record a copy of order dated 25th April, 2016 passed by the Hon\u0027ble High Court, Bombay in Anticipatory Bail Application no. 661/2016 in the matter of Rahul Raj Singh Vs. The State of Maharashtra. Accordingly, bail is contended. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5) Bail application is resisted by the APP by filing say at Exh. 5 on the grounds that, the accused was in love with deceased. They were in frequent touch with each other through mobile phone calls even at late nights. Accused has subjected the deceased to mental harassment. She has disclosed to this informant being a real brother. Accused committed suicide being unable to bear the harassments by this accused. APP contended that, investigation is yet continuing, therefore apprehensions of pressurizing or influencing the witnesses or the informant, tampering of evidences cannot be ruled it. Accordingly, bail is resisted. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6) Upon hearing the APP and applicant\u0027s advocate, perusing the papers it appears that, allegations are of the accused being in love affair with the informant\u0027s sister. Allegations are of she being harassed by the accused and being unable to bear it, has committed suicide. Accused is arrested on the same day of lodging FIR. Accused\u0027 mobile, SIM­card and Memory­card are already seized. Accused\u0027s advocate\u0027s contention about allegations of abatement of suicide are made out or not, shall be matter of trial. However, the nature of FIR does not entail any further seizure or recoveries at the instance of accused. It is uncertain as to the time to be consumed for filing of charge­sheet and trial to conclude. In such circumstances it appears that, no much purpose will be served by keeping the accused arrested any further. However, APP\u0027s apprehensions are also required to be taken care of. Hence, the following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER 1) Criminal Bail Application no. 61/2019, is allowed. 2) Accused Imran Harun Bagwan, be released on bail, from arrest under C.R. no. 17/2019, registered at Borgaon police station, on his furnishing personal bond of Rs. 50,000/­ (Rs. Fifty Thousand) with two solvent sureties to make up the bond amounts, on following terms and conditions; a) Accused shall cause his attendance twice at the concerned police station preferably on every Tuesday and Saturday in each week at any time in between 11.00 a.m. to 2.00 p.m. till further orders. b) Accused shall not tamper with any evidence. c) Accused shall not directly or indirectly make any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the case so as to dissuade him from disclosing such facts to the court or to any Police Officer. d) Accused shall make available himself and co­operate for interrogation by Police Officer as and when required. e) Any default of above conditions shall render the bail to be cancelled automatically. f) Compliance before lower Court. \r\n---order-ends---\r\n(Y.
