  "processedText": "..1… IN THE COURT OF SPECIAL JUDGE UNDER POCSO ACT AND ADDITIONAL SESSIONS JUDGE, BARAMATI. Cri. Bail Appln. No. 07/2019. MHPU14­000025­2019. Shrirang Yashwant Shinde Versus State of Maharashtra \r\n---header-ends---\r\nORDER BELOW EXHIBIT 1 This is an application for grant of regular bail under Section 439 of Cr.P.C. in Crime No. 6/2019 of Bhigwan police station registered under Sections 354, 506 of Indian Penal Code and Sections 9 and 10 of POCSO Act. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2] The applicant contended that false and fabricated case is lodged against him. There is delay of around 4 days in lodging the FIR. He is not concerned with the crime. He is in jail from past 05.01.2019. He alleged that there is no severe sexual harassment in the FIR. He is permanent resident of village Akole, Tal­ Indapur, Dist­Pune. Hence, he has prayed for bail on any terms and conditions. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3] The I.O. filed say at Exh.3 through the ld. APP and resisted the application. Already 2­3 dates are been given to police to obtain the say of victim, but the police have not obtained say nor served the notice to the victim. The ld. APP has submitted that the victim and the accused are the neighbourers. If accused is released on bail, he will tamper the prosecution evidence and will threat the witnesses. He will repeat the same crime. Hence he has prayed for bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4] Heard both the parties counsel at length. They have argued as stated above. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5] In this case, as per the prosecution story, on dt. 01.01.2019 the victim along with her friends were sitting on the platform of house of Maya Shinde and thereafter, her friends went after completion of study and while she was keeping her books in the bag, that time accused came near her and pulled her and gagged her mouth and taken her in the house. He lifted her frock and then misbehaved with her and touched her body. Then, the victim cried and he threatened her that if she tell the incident to anyone, then he will kill her. Thereafter, the report was lodged on 04.01.2019. It appears to the Court that the accused is in jail from 05.01.2019 and his custodial interrogation is not necessary. Except touching the body of the victim aged about 9 years, no severe sexual assault was committed. The victim or any of the witnesses have not stated that where the accused has touched the victim. It appears to the court that there is three days delay in lodging the FIR. The said is not explained in the FIR. Also it appears to the Court that the accused is in jail since 05.01.2019 and no purpose would be served by keeping him in jail. On suitable terms and conditions he can be enlarged on bail. Hence, the following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER (1) The application is allowed. (2) The applicant Shrirang Yashwant Shinde be released on P.B. of Rs. 15,000/­ along with one or two sureties in the like amount, on the condition that:  a) He shall attend the concerned police station on every Sunday and Wednesday between 11.00 am to 2.00 pm till filing of the charge­sheet and co­operate the police in investigation. b) He shall not tamper the prosecution evidence. c) He shall not threat the prosecution witnesses and victim. d) He shall furnish his address and contact number. e) He shall not commit similar type of offence. f) He shall not leave India without permission of the Court.
