Thus, there remains no element of any seizure or recovery to be done at the instance of accused.

State of Maharashtra) CNR : MHST01­000386­2019 \r\n---header-ends---\r\n1) Present bail application is preferred by the accused Vishwanath Baburao Shewale, under section 439 of Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 seeking his release from arrest, under C.R. no. 11/2019, registered at Bhuinj Police Station on 28/01/2019 at the instance of Vikas Rohidas Sonawane, Food Safety Officer, for alleged commission of offences punishable under sections 188, 272, 273 and 328 of Indian Penal Code, 1860 alongwith sections 59(i), 26(2)(1), 26(2)(4), 27(3)(e) and 30 (2)(A) of Food Safety and Measurements Rules, 2006 and also alongwith sections 3.1.7 and 2.3.4 of Food Safety and Measurements Rules, 2011. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2) It is contended by applicant\u0027s advocate that, the applicant has been falsely arrested under the said offences, inspite of having not committed any offences alleged. It is contended by the applicant\u0027s advocate that, Gutka or Pan Masala or scented tobacco in itself cannot be poisonousness elements. It is further contended that, the said articles cannot be said to be poisonousness articles also. Applicant\u0027s advocate has placed reliance on the order passed in Ganesh Pandurang Jadhao Vs. The State of Maharashtra 2016 Cr.L.J. 2401 : 2016(2) BCR (Cri) 4. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3) It is further contended by the applicant\u0027s advocate that, accused is arrested on 28/01/2019 and is in MCR since 29/01/2019. There is no element of seizure or recovery to be done. Accused is a permanent resident of village Wai, aged about 59 years being the sole bread earner for his family. It is further contended that, filing of charge­sheet and the trial may take its own time. Accordingly, bail is contended. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4) Bail application is resisted by the APP by filing say at Exh. 4 on the grounds that, accused was arrested for illegally selling and keeping poisonousness and prohibited food articles like Gutka, Pan Masala and scented tobacco. Offences are serious in nature, punishable with 10 years imprisonment and fine. Investigation is in process. In case of releasing accused on bail, repetition of similar offence, tampering the evidence, pressurizing the witnesses, cannot be ruled out, accordingly bail is resisted. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5) Upon perusing FIR, the investigation papers and other documents submitted on record, hearing the APP and the accused\u0027s advocate, it appears that, accused is arrested with the prohibited articles. Thus, it appears that, element of seizures are already completed either before or at the time of arresting the accused. Thus, there remains no element of any seizure or recovery to be done at the instance of accused. Further, the fact that accused was in police custody only for a day, there cannot be any grievance of non co­operation in investigation. Undisputedly, filing of charge­sheet and trial to conclude shall take its own time, which is uncertain at this moment. Thus, taking into consideration the nature of FIR, it appears that, no much purpose will be served by keeping the accused arrested. However, APP\u0027s apprehensions are also to be taken care of. Hence, the following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER 1) Criminal Bail Application no. 70/2019, is allowed. 2) Accused Vishwanath Baburao Shewale, be released on bail, from his arrest under C.R. no. 11/2019, registered at Bhuinj Police Station, on his furnishing personal bond of Rs.25,000/­ (Rs. Twenty Five Thousand) with one solvent surety, to make up the bond amount, on following terms and conditions; a) Accused shall cause his attendance twice at the \u003d3\u003d concerned police station preferably on every Wednesday and Saturday at any time in between 11.00 a.m. to 2.00 p.m. till further orders. b) Accused shall not tamper with any evidence. c) Accused shall not directly or indirectly make any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the case so as to dissuade him from disclosing such facts to the court or to any Police Officer. d) Accused shall make available himself and co­operate for interrogation by Police Officer as and when required. e) Any default of above conditions shall render the bail to be cancelled automatically. f) Compliance before lower Court. \r\n---order-ends---\r\n(Y.
