Perused the application and say filed by the prosecution at Exh.6. Gone through the investigation papers. Heard learned Advocate for the applicant and the learned A.P.P. for the State. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n03. It is vehemently argued by the learned Advocate for the applicant that, applicant is arrested on 13.01.2019 and now he is in MCR. Applicant is falsely involved in the alleged crime. Applicant is the only earning hand in his family. Applicant has no criminal background or never previously convicted. If applicant is released on bail, he is ready to abide any conditions, if so imposed by this Court. Applicant will not abscond or will not misuse his liberty. Learned Advocate for applicant prayed to allow the application. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n04. It is vehemently argued by learned A.P.P. that, allegations against applicant are serious and he was found while manufacturing illicit liquor. Applicant succeeded to run away from the spot. Police seized 40 litres country made liquor and articles used for manufacturing illicit liquor. Relatives of applicant restrained police while they were discharging their duty of arresting the applicant and Crime No.10 of 2019 is registered against relatives of applicant. If applicant is released on bail he will repeat similar type of crime. There is likelihood of his absconding. Investigation is in progress. Yet absconding accused is to be arrested. Applicant will 2 Cri.M.A.No.34 of 2019. help the absconding accused. If applicant is released on bail he will definitely pressurise the witnesses. Learned A.P.P. prayed to reject the application. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n05. I have gone through the investigation papers. From the complaint, it reveals that, on 12.01.2019, at about 05.30 p.m. within the vicinity of village Choudharwadi near the Morya Canal bridge accused and one unknown person was manufacturing illicit liquor with intent to cause hurt to such person and after noticing police flee away from the spot of incident. From the remand papers, it reveals that, applicant is in MCR. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n06. From the say of learned A.P.P., it reveals that, if applicant is released on bail he will repeat same type of crime and there is likelihood of his absconding. Applicant will help the absconding accused and will pressurise the witnesses. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n07. Considering the nature of offence, punishment provided for it, I think that, it would be just and proper to impose some conditions on applicant so that he will not be in a position to misuse his liberty by any manner. Hence, I proceed to pass the following order.\r\n---argument-ends---\r\n ORDER 1. Application of applicant by name Sunny Manik Jadhav is hereby allowed. 2.
