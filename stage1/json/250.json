  "processedText": "ORDER BELOW EXH.01 IN CRI. BAIL APPLN. NO. 53/2019 Vijay Bapu Madane Vs. State of Maharashtra \r\n---header-ends---\r\nThis is an application for regular bail as per section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Heard advocate Mr. Budhavale for applicant. He submitted that in Crime No.143/2018 registered with Medha Police Station for the offence punishable under section 392 read with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, applicant is behind the bars since 19/12/2018. \r\n---background-ends---\r\nHe was remanded in police custody for six days and thereafter as prayed by the police, he is taken in Magisterial custody. Part of his custodial interrogation is over. His further presence is no more required for investigation. He is of young age and the sole earning member in the family. He is local resident. He is ready to furnish surety to the satisfaction of this Court and is also ready to obey with all the conditions those may be imposed upon him. During his custodial interrogation, nothing is recovered from him. In spite of giving ample opportunity, prosecution has not conducted his identification parade. Therefore he submitted that by imposing certain conditions, applicant may be released on bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n2. APP Mr. Muke by filing his say at Exh.4 strongly resisted the application. He submitted that though the FIR is against unknown person, on the basis of description given in the FIR, applicant came to be arrested. Identification parade of applicant is required to be conducted. One more accused is yet to be arrested. The looted articles and the vehicles used in the commission of offence are to be seized. Applicant is habitual offender. If he is released on bail then he is likely to abscond. Therefore he submitted that application may be rejected. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3. Considering the say filed by prosecution at Exh.4, one more opportunity was given to it for the purpose of conducting identification parade. After making inquiry with APP Mr. Muke, he submitted that the Tahasildar arranged for identification parade. Notice was issued to the informant. But he did not remain present in the District Prison and therefore identification parade could not be conducted. He also submitted that there are no immediate chances of conducting identification parade. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4. After going through the FIR, it is seen that, it is against unknown persons. It seems that this applicant came to be arrested merely on the ground that one more Crime bearing No.334/2017 is registered against him with Bhuinj Police Station for similar offence. However after his arrest, he was in the custody of police for one week. During his custodial interrogation, nothing is recovered at his instance and as prayed by the police, he is taken in Magisterial custody. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5. The period of about two months is likely to be completed. Practically by this time, investigation might have been 3/4 Criminal Bail Application No. 53/2019 completed. In spite of giving ample opportunity, prosecution did not conduct identification parade. As fairly submitted by APP Mr. Muke, informant himself did not remain present for the purpose of identification parade. There are no immediate chances of conducting his identification parade. Certified copies of remand reports are produced on record by the applicant. It is nowhere mentioned in the said remand reports that applicant was produced before the JMFC by covering his face. The ground of identification parade is also not mentioned in both the remand reports. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6. Applicant is of young age and local resident. Alleged offence is not punishable with death or imprisonment for life. By imposing certain conditions, he deserves to be released on bail. Hence the order follows :­ \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER 1 Application is allowed. 2 In Crime No. 143/2018 registered with Medha Police Station for the offence punishable under section 392 read with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, applicant Vijay Bapu Madane, be released on bail upon his executing P.R. Bond of Rs.15,000/­ (Rs. fifteen thousands) with one surety in the like amount on following conditions : i) that he shall attend Medha Police Station on every Sunday in between 11.00 a.m. to 12.00 noon till filing of the charge­sheet. 4/4 Criminal Bail Application No. 53/2019 ii) that he shall not directly or indirectly, make any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the accusation against him so as to dissuade him from disclosing such facts to the Court or to any police officer. iii) that he shall not tamper with the evidence of prosecution in any manner. 3 Failure to obey any of the conditions above, would be liable to cancellation of bail granted to applicant. 4 Bail before the lower Court. \r\n---order-ends---\r\n(Order is dictated and pronounced in the open Court). Satara (R.D.Deshpande) Dt. 06/02/2019. Additional Sessions Judge, Satara."
