Both applicants / accused and complainant were graduate in Law. Their relations were going on for a long period. It is observed by hon\u0027ble High Court that to keep physical relationship or not is a choice of both parties. Prima facie it did not appear from record that complainant was either forced to keep sexual relationship or she was really induced to such an extent that she has no other option but to keep physical relationship with applicant / accused. Hon\u0027ble High Court further observed, even though if at all there is bonafide promise to marry and the girl chooses to keep physical relationship with that person and if a boy withdraw his promise, as they are not psychologically comfortable with each other, then it can not bring that particular act within purport of offence under section 375 of I.P.C. Hon\u0027ble High Court further observed the complainant is an educated girl and it shows that it was her conscious decision to keep sexual relations with applicant. Prima facie at that stage possibility of non committal , consensual relationship can not be denied. Hence anticipatory bail was granted.",

  "processedText": "Order below Exh.01 in Cri.Bail Application No. 126/2019 : (Prashant Kshirsagar Vs. State of Maharashtra) (CNR No. MHST01­000638/2019 ) \r\n---header-ends---\r\nIt is an application taken out by the applicant praying for anticipatory bail under section 438 of Cr.P.C. By filing say at Exh.04, prosecution strongly resisted the application. Heard ld. advocate Shri. Hutgikar for the applicant, so also ld. A.P.P. Mrs. Diwakar for prosecution at length. None present on behalf of aid to prosecution. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n02] In view of the rival submissions, only point arises for determination is, “Whether the application can be allowed ?” My finding to this point is \u0027 in the negative\u0027 , for the reasons to follow : R E A S O N S \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n03] It is submitted on behalf of the applicant that crime no.25/2019 has been registered against him with Satara City Police Station. The applicant is innocent. Other two accused have been granted bail for the same offence. As per the victim herself, marriage was performed with her by the applicant. Hence, section 376 of I.P.C. can not be attracted. Perusal of F.I.R. shows that, there is love in between the applicant and the informant. Therefore, the theory of forcible rape does not come into play. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n04] It is further submitted that, if rape was committed then why the victim has not registered the F.I.R ? F.I.R. is filed by the victim only after she was not accepted by the family members of the applicant. The complaint has been registered only with an intention to harass and bend the applicant and his family members. As everything has happened with the consent of victim, the offence as alleged is not Order below Exh.01 /2/ Cr.Bail Appln.No.126/19 made out. There is delay of about one year and 8 months. No satisfactory explanation is given for the same. F.I.R has been lodged upon false and fabricated story. Marriage has been conducted on 05/05/2018. Still there is delay of about 8 months in lodging of F.I.R. The applicant is not likely to jump the bail and will not tamper prosecution witnesses. There are no criminal antecedents. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n05] Per contra, it is submitted on behalf prosecution that the applicant has repeatedly committed rape on the victim by giving false promise of marriage. Applicant has given threats to the informant to terminate the pregnancy and offered Rs.50,000/­ to close the matter. He has also threatened to kill the family members of informant. He has also administered her some pills and caused death of foetus of the informant. Investigation is in progress. Custody of applicant is necessary for deep and thorough investigation. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n06] Ld. defence counsel took me to the F.I.R. It prima facie shows that the informant is a mature lady about 30 years old. The first incident of alleged rape as per F.I.R. is dated 08/05/2017. Whereas, F.I.R. is lodged on 08/01/2019. It thus appeared that the first informant and applicant were in sexual relationship for a long period. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n07] In this context, ld. defence counsel placed reliance on the observations of hon\u0027ble parent High Court in following authorities : 1) Sunil Laxman Patil Vs. State of Maharashtra, 2007 ALL MR ( Cri.) 1693. It is observed in this case that complaint was filed after about 9 months of the alleged incidents and prosecutrix was aged 27 years, possessing degree in Law, it was fit case to grant anticipatory bail. 2) Mahesh Balkrishna Dandane Vs. State of Maharashtra, Order below Exh.01 /3/ Cr.Bail Appln.No.126/19 2014 4 Crimes ( HC) 37. In this case, offence alleged was under sections 420, 406, 376, 323 and 506 (ii). Both applicants / accused and complainant were graduate in Law. Their relations were going on for a long period. It is observed by hon\u0027ble High Court that to keep physical relationship or not is a choice of both parties. Prima facie it did not appear from record that complainant was either forced to keep sexual relationship or she was really induced to such an extent that she has no other option but to keep physical relationship with applicant / accused. Hon\u0027ble High Court further observed, even though if at all there is bonafide promise to marry and the girl chooses to keep physical relationship with that person and if a boy withdraw his promise, as they are not psychologically comfortable with each other, then it can not bring that particular act within purport of offence under section 375 of I.P.C. Hon\u0027ble High Court further observed the complainant is an educated girl and it shows that it was her conscious decision to keep sexual relations with applicant. Prima facie at that stage possibility of non committal , consensual relationship can not be denied. Hence anticipatory bail was granted. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n08] In the case at hand, however, there are no mere allegations under section 376 of I.P.C. It is alleged that the applicant also caused death of the child in the womb of the complainant by administering some substance and that she was also being threatened for such abortion previously. In view of the nature of offence alleged, i.e. under section 313 of I.P.C. , custodial interrogation of the accused/applicant is certainly necessary. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n09] No doubt, the applicant has produced certain documents i.e. copy of marriage certificate issued by a Purohit, still birth certificate Order below Exh.01 /4/ Cr.Bail Appln.No.126/19 and a copy of MOU in between the informant and one Ganesh Anant Kumbhar, showing that the informant had illicit relations with him dated 22/04/2015. Prima facie these are not of any help to the accused in respect to all the offences alleged against him. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n10] Therefore , for all aforesaid reasons, this is not a fit case to grant anticipatory bail. Since, allegations against the other accused are different, law of parity can not be applied to present applicant. For all these reasons, I proceed to pass following order: \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nO R D E R The application stands rejected. (Dictated and pronounced in open Court ) \r\n---order-ends---\r\nSatara. Date: 06/05/2019 ( Varsha B. Pargaonkar) Addl.Sessions Judge, Satara."
