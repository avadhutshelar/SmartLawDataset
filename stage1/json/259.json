(CNR No.MHST01­000375­2019) 01. \r\n---header-ends---\r\nThe applicant, namely, Gitanjali Vivek Gaikwad apprehending her arrest in C.R.No.24 of 2019 for the offences punishable under Sections 323 and 506 of the Indian Penal Code and Section 75 of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, registered with Phaltan City Police Station, has filed this application under Section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for adinterim anticipatory bail. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n02. Perused application. Heard learned Advocate Shri.D.V.Patil for the applicant. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n03. From the contents of complaint of Dashrath Rajaram Gaikwad in C.R.No.24 of 2019, it reveals that, Vivek is his son and applicant is second wife of Vivek. After the death of first wife, Vivek married with applicant on 23.06.2012. Vivek is Chartered Accountant and working in his Office at Phaltan from 09.00 a.m. to 05.00 p.m. Mahesh Vasantrao Saste is maternal uncle of Atharva and doing paint business at Phaltan. Athava, aged 13 years, is son of Vivek. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n04. From the complaint, it reveals that, from 11.01.2019 at about 03.00 p.m., when complainant was at his house at village Taradgaon, he received phone call of Mahesh Saste and Mahesh told him that, applicant who is step­mother of Atharva is harassing Atharva. Atharva is in fear. Atharva came at village Nirgudi. Mahesh Saste told complainant to come at village. Nirgudi, as such, on 12.01.2019, complainant went at village Nirgudi at the house of Mahesh Saste. During inquiry, complainant came to know from Atharva that, prior to arrival of his father, usually applicant was threatening him, used to serve stale food to him, used to ask him to clean toilet and bathroom and in absence of maid servant used to ask him to clean utencils by threatening him. If said work is not done, applicant used to beat Atharva. It is further told by Atharva that, applicant was threatening him and getting the work done and if work is not done used to assault him. Applicant was threatening Atharva that, if he told his father as to the attitude of applicant she will punish him double. Whenever Atharva once or twice complained as to the attitude of applicant with his father, there were quarrels between his father and applicant. However, on next day applicant was harassing more to Atharva. On 11.01.2019, father of Atharva was going abroad and at that time, applicant threatened Atharva that, she will beat him after his father went abroad. On 11.01.2019, Atharva went at school and after school straight way went to the shop of his maternal uncle by name Mahesh Saste at Phaltan and from there went to Nirgudi along with his grandfather Vasantrao Saste. Atharva told complainant that, his step­mother i.e. applicant is harassing him from last four to five years. On 19.01.2019, after Vivek returned from abroad, complainant discussed with him and lodged complaint. At the time of lodging complaint, Vivek and Atharva were with him. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n05. It is argued by learned Advocate for applicant that, 3 Cri.M.A.No.64 of 2019. there is delay in lodging FIR. There is no explanation why no complaint was lodged in respect of alleged harassment which allegedly had been taken place prior to four to five years. It was further argued that, had applicant was harassing Atharva, it was not possible for Atharva to get 80 % marks in school examination. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n06. True that, from the complaint, it reveals that, Atharva went at the shop of Mahesh Saste on 11.01.2019 and complaint is lodged on 20.01.2019. However, complaint indicates that, on 19.01.2019, Vivek who is father of Atharva returned from abroad and then after, after discussing with Vivek, his grandfather Dashrath Rajaram Gaikwad lodged the complaint. When complaint was lodged Vivek and Atharva were with complainant at Police Station. From the contents of complaint, prima facie, it reveals that, from 11.01.2019 to 19.01.2019, Vivek, who is father of Atharva and who is son of complainant was at abroad, as such, complaint was not lodged. Complaint prima facie indicates that, after Vivek was returned from abroad and after discussing with him, his father lodged the complaint. This conduct of complainant prima facie seems to be natural and conduct of ordinary prudent man. Hence, I am not at all impressed with the submission in respect of delay in lodging the FIR. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n07. From the contents of application, it reveals that, Vivek has purchased some property in the name of applicant and said act was disliked by maternal and paternal grandparents of Atharva. From the application it further reveals that, recently Vivek purchased plot at Pune in the name of applicant and said act was not liked by paternal and maternal grandparents, uncle and aunt of Atharva as they were willing that, Vivek should purchase the plot in the name of Atharva and as such, they were annoyed. No prima facie evidence is placed on record to opine that, Vivek purchased some property in the name of applicant, as such, the maternal and paternal grandparents of Atharva were annoyed. Hence, I do not find any substance in the said argument. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n08. Considering the age of Atharva, prima facie it cannot be said that, he was used as a tool by his grandparents to lodge the complaint against applicant. Had it been so, complainant should not have waited till the arrival of Vivek from abroad to lodge the complaint. Moreover, at the time of lodging the complaint, Vivek and Atharva were with complainant and same reflects in the complaint. 09. Considering the nature and seriousness of the offence, considering the age of Atharva, I am of the view that, this is not a fit case in which interim anticipatory bail can be granted.
