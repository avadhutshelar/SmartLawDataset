He submitted that Crime No. 7/2019 is registered against this applicant with Koregaon Police Station for the offences punishable under sections 406 and 381 read with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code. He is having strong apprehension of his arrest in this crime. Informant merely deposited some amount in his account and applicant, in turn has paid that amount to the contractor of informant regarding sugarcane crushing. Informant independently has executed notarized agreement with one Dipakkumar Rajkumar regarding labours for his sugarcane crusher. But since all those labourers fled away from the spot along­with electric motors etc., informant has lodged FIR against them. He has falsely implicated this applicant.",

  "processedText": "ORDER BELOW EXH.01 IN CRI. BAIL APPLN. NO.25/2019 CNR­MHST01­000211­2019 Ajay alias Ajit Krushnarao Pol Vs. State of Maharashtra \r\n---header-ends---\r\nThis is an application for anticipatory bail as per section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Heard advocate Mr. Jadhav for applicant. He submitted that Crime No. 7/2019 is registered against this applicant with Koregaon Police Station for the offences punishable under sections 406 and 381 read with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code. He is having strong apprehension of his arrest in this crime. Informant merely deposited some amount in his account and applicant, in turn has paid that amount to the contractor of informant regarding sugarcane crushing. Informant independently has executed notarized agreement with one Dipakkumar Rajkumar regarding labours for his sugarcane crusher. But since all those labourers fled away from the spot along­with electric motors etc., informant has lodged FIR against them. He has falsely implicated this applicant. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2. He further submitted that applicant is of young age and acting Sarpanch of the village Gondavale Khurd. If he is arrested on false accusation then his reputation would be maligned and therefore he prayed that application may be allowed. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3. APP Mr. Muke by filing his say at Exh.8 resisted the application. He submitted that the informant entered into contract with other accused in respect of his sugarcane crushing machine at the instance of this applicant. He has introduced the remaining accused to the informant who has paid an amount of Rs.1,90,000/­. Inquiry to that effect is to be carried out. This applicant is aware about the addresses of remaining accused. Therefore his custodial interrogation is necessary. For that purpose, he prayed that application may be rejected. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4. After going through the FIR lodged by informant Govind Chivate, it is seen that, present applicant has merely introduced other accused to him for the purpose of his sugarcane crushing. Applicant himself is also dealing in the same business. An amount of Rs.1,90,000/­ is already paid by the informant to the main accused Dipakkumar Rajkumar Faridwala merely by means of bank account of this applicant, but he has not accepted the single Pai in this transaction. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5. What is important to note is that informant and main accused Dipakkumar Rajkumar have entered into a notarized agreement before advocate and notary Mr. Vijay Shinde of Koregaon thereby keeping in writing all the terms and conditions regarding the sugarcane crushing. Under these circumstances, custodial interrogation of this applicant is not at all necessary by the police. Main accused Dipakkumar Rajkumar was already arrested by the police on 10/01/2019. He was remanded in police custody for three days. Thereafter he was taken in Magisterial custody and is already released on bail by the lower Court. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6. Main accused Dipakkumar and other accused are belonging to Uttar Pradesh. Custodial interrogation of main accused Dipakkumar is already done by the police regarding addresses of remaining accused. So far as this applicant is concerned, he appears to be a respectable person since he is the acting Sarpanch of the village Gondavale Budruk. 7. Considering the allegations in the FIR, he deserves to get pre­arrest protection. Because main allegations in the FIR are against the arrested accused Dipakkumar Rajkumar and remaining accused. Custodial interrogation of this applicant is not at all warranted. Ad­interim pre­arrest protection is already granted by this Court to him by an order dated 16/01/2019. That ad­interim pre­arrest protection deserves to be confirmed with the same conditions.
