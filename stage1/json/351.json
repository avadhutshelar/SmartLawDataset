I have also perused police papers produced for examination. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[6] Nature of the offence alleged to have committed by the accused is serious. Material collected by the prosecution shows, involvement of the applicant-accused in the commission of crime. Further it appears, investigation of the present crime is in the progress. Possibility of putting pressure upon the witnesses by the applicant-accused cannot be ruled out. Possibility expressed that the applicant-accused would abscond if bail is granted also carry substance in the background some other offences are registered against the applicant-accused. Thus, in such situation, in my opinion, it is not desirable to accept request made on behalf of the applicant-accused. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[7] In the result, following order is passed- \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER Bail Application stands rejected. Accordingly order is passed and the bail application stands disposed of. Baramati \r\n---order-ends---\r\n( R.B. Deshpande) 24.01.2019 Addl. Sessions Judge, Baramati.
