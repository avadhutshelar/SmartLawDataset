BAIL APPLN NO. 1 OF 2019 ORDER BELOW EXH. 1 MHPU14-000001-2019 \r\n---header-ends---\r\n[1] Present application is filed by the accused namely Kabutarya @ Sujit Raju kale claiming bail u/s. 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, against whom Crime No. 218 of 2018, is registered in Daund Railway police station (Districtâ€“Pune ), for having committed offences punishable U/s. 395 of IPC. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n[2] It is prosecution case, on 8/11/2018 applicant-accused with other accused committed decoity when train no. 17017 was standing nearby Bhigwan outer signal. It is prosecution case, accused snatched and took away gold Mangalsutra of the informant Lalita Jain who was travelling by the aforesaid train. It is prosecution case, muddemal property is recovered from another accused Sonya.

I have also perused police papers produced for examination. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[6] Nature of the offence alleged to have committed by the accused is serious. Material collected by the prosecution shows, involvement of the applicant-accused in the commission of crime. Further it appears, investigation of the present crime is in the progress. Possibility of putting pressure upon the witnesses by the applicant-accused cannot be ruled out. Possibility expressed that the applicant-accused would abscond if bail is granted also carry substance in the background some other offences are registered against the applicant-accused. Thus, in such situation, in my opinion, it is not desirable to accept request made on behalf of the applicant-accused. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[7] In the result, following order is passed- \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER Bail Application stands rejected. Accordingly order is passed and the bail application stands disposed of. Baramati \r\n---order-ends---\r\n( R.B. Deshpande) 24.01.2019 Addl. Sessions Judge, Baramati.
