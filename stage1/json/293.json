Applicant is falsely implicated out of political rivalry. Remaining all accused involved in this crime are enlarged on bail either by this Court or by Hon\u0027ble Bombay High Court. Moreover, investigation is already completed and charge­sheet is submitted by the police before the CJM, Satara bearing RCC No.24/2018. Applicant is respectable person and the businessman at Satara. If he is arrested then his reputation is likely to be maligned. His presence is no more required by the police. Therefore he submitted that on the ground of parity also and by imposing certain conditions, applicant may be granted pre­arrest protection.",

  "processedText": "ORDER BELOW EXH.01 IN CRI. MISC. APPLN. NO.101/2019 Yogesh Vitthal Chorge Vs. State of Maharashtra CNR­MHST01­000512­2019 \r\n---header-ends---\r\nThis is an application for anticipatory bail as per section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Heard advocate Mr. Narkar for applicant. He submitted that applicant is apprehending his arrest in C.R. No. 398/2017 registered with Shahupuri Police Station for the offences punishable under sections 307 etc. read with section 149 of the Indian Penal Code. Applicant is falsely implicated out of political rivalry. Remaining all accused involved in this crime are enlarged on bail either by this Court or by Hon\u0027ble Bombay High Court. Moreover, investigation is already completed and charge­sheet is submitted by the police before the CJM, Satara bearing RCC No.24/2018. Applicant is respectable person and the businessman at Satara. If he is arrested then his reputation is likely to be maligned. His presence is no more required by the police. Therefore he submitted that on the ground of parity also and by imposing certain conditions, applicant may be granted pre­arrest protection. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2. APP Mr. Oak by filing his say at Exh.6 strongly resisted the application. He replied that, there is rivalry in between two political groups of MP and MLA. Alleged incident has taken place out of such political rivalry and on account of handing over business of Aanewadi Toll Plaza. If applicant is granted pre­arrest protection then he is likely to repeat such type of offence. During the course of investigation, involvement of this applicant in the commission of offence is transpired. Though charge­sheet is submitted, it would not be just and safe to grant pre­arrest protection to this applicant. Therefore he submitted that application may be rejected. He fairly submitted that other accused involved in this crime are already enlarged on bail either by this Court or by Hon\u0027ble Bombay High Court. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3. After going through the FIR and the documents on record, it is seen that other accused having played similar role in the commission of alleged offences, are granted anticipatory bail by my learned predecessor and Additional Sessions Judge (Smt. Ghule) in Criminal M.A. No. 167/2018 to in all 23 accused persons. So also my learned colleague and Additional Sessions Judge has granted anticipatory bail to remaining accused in Criminal M.A. Nos. 259/2018, 65/2018, 293/2018 etc. It is undisputed fact that Hon\u0027ble Bombay High Court has also granted anticipatory bail to remaining accused. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4. Investigation is completed and charge­sheet is submitted by the police before the CJM, Satara bearing RCC No. 24/2018. It indicates that custodial interrogation of this applicant is not at all warranted. As such he deserves for pre­arrest protection, but subject to certain conditions. Hence the order follows :­ \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER 1 Application is allowed. 2 In the event of his arrest in Crime No. 398/2017 registered with Shahupuri Police Station for the offences punishable under sections 307 etc. read with section 149 of the Indian Penal Code, applicant Yogesh Vitthal Chorge, be released on anticipatory bail,upon his executing P.R.Bond of Rs.25,000/­ (Rs. Twenty five thousands) with one solvent surety in the like amount on following conditions : i. that he shall attend Shahupuri Police Station twice in a week i.e. on every Wednesday and Sunday in between 11.00 a.m. to 1.00 pm. without fail till charge­sheet is filed against him. ii. that he shall not directly or indirectly, make any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the accusation against him so as to dissuade them from disclosing such facts to the Court or to any police officer. iii. that he shall not threaten informant or witnesses of the prosecution in any way. iv. that he shall not tamper with the evidence of prosecution n any manner. 3 Failure to obey any of the conditions above, would be liable to cancellation of anticipatory bail granted to applicant. 4 Inform Shahupuri Police Station accordingly. (Order is dictated and pronounced in the open Court) \r\n---order-ends---\r\nSatara (R.D.Deshpande) Dt.08/03/2019. Additional Sessions Judge, Satara."
