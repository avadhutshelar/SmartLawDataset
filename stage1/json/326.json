  "processedText": "ORDER BELOW EXH.01 IN CRI. MISC. APPLN. NO. 136/2019 MHST01­000679­2019 Ali Masjeed Sayyad Vs. State of Maharashtra \r\n---header-ends---\r\nThis is the second application for anticipatory bail as per section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Heard advocate Mr. Katkar for applicant. He submitted that Crime No.19/2019 is registered against this applicant with Shahupuri Police Station for the offences punishable under sections 306 etc. read with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code and under sections 39 and 45 of the Money Laundering Act, 2014. \r\n---background-ends---\r\nApplicant is apprehending his arrest in this Crime. According to him, applicant has no concern of any sort with this crime. He is falsely implicated by the informant merely at the instance of other accused. Applicant has not played any role in abetting, aiding or instigating the deceased to commit suicide. There was some hand­loan transaction in between the deceased and Anwar. Out of that money transaction, he seems to have committed suicide. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n2. He further submitted that applicant is local resident and is of young age. He is ready to obey with all the conditions those may be imposed upon him. He has reputation in the society. If he is arrested then his reputation would be maligned. He has no criminal background. He is the sole earning member in his family and therefore by imposing certain conditions, applicant may be released on bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3. He relied upon the case of M. Arjunan Vs. State of Tamilnadu, reported in 2019 CLU 223, in which it is held by Hon\u0027ble Apex Court that, “though accused might have used some abusive words to the deceased having advanced money to him, insulting the deceased by using abusive language would not by itself constitute the abetment of suicide. An offence under section 306 of the Indian Penal Code is not made out.” Advocate Mr. Katkar further submitted that other accused in this crime are already released on bail. Investigation is practically completed. Therefore on the ground of parity also, applicant deserves to be granted anticipatory bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4. APP Mr. Oak by filing his say at Exh.11 strongly resisted the application. He submitted that, first Anticipatory Bail Application filed by this applicant bearing No. 17/2019 came to be rejected on merits by this Court. In that situation, it was for applicant to surrender before the police. But without doing so, he has filed another application for anticipatory bail. His custodial interrogation is warranted taking into consideration illegal money lending business being carried out by him. Against hand­loan of Rs.2,50,000/­, an amount of Rs.3,50,000/­ is recovered by this applicant and his associates from the deceased. One stamp paper was also got executed from the deceased, but his money is not paid to him. Taking into consideration the gravity of offences, pre­ arrest protection may not be granted to applicant. Though other accused are released on bail, they have undergone custodial interrogation after their arrest. Therefore rule of parity is not applicable to this applicant. Therefore he submitted that application may be rejected. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5. After going through the FIR lodged by the wife of deceased, it is seen that since prior to about three weeks of the incident, her deceased husband used to be under severe mental stress. Upon asked about it, he disclosed that he has borrowed hand­loan of amount of Rs.2,50,000/­ from Anwar Shaikh and present applicant. He has repaid an amount of Rs.3,50,000/­, but still they were demanding Rs.2,50,000/­ more and interest at the rate of Rs.25,000/­ per month. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6. It is also seen that when she asked about it to accused as to why such huge amount was lent to her husband, they behaved arrogantly. Thereafter her husband was asked to bring stamp paper of Rs.100/­. It was mentioned that he received an amount of Rs.2,50,000/­, but in fact an amount of Rs.1,15,000/­ only was paid to him and remaining amount was not paid on account of interest. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n7. In the FIR and during the course of investigation carried out till this date, role of this applicant is transpired. His custodial interrogation is required by the police in view of illegal money lending business being carried out by him. Though other accused are released on bail, it was not pre­arrest bail. But they were arrested and after they undergone custodial interrogation, they came to be released on bail by my learned predecessor. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n8. Taking into consideration nature and seriousness of accusation and the gravity of offences, applicant does not deserve to get pre­arrest protection. His presence is certainly required for investigation purpose. If pre­arrest protection is granted to him then entire investigation would be paralyzed. The rule of parity is not applicable to this applicant. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n9. I have carefully gone through facts of the cited case M. Arjunan Vs. State of Tamilnadu, on which advocate of applicant Mr. Katkar placed his reliance. In the cited case deceased left the suicide note. There was nothing in the suicide note to indicate that there was instigation by the accused to drive the deceased to take extreme step of committing suicide. Such is not the fact situation in the case at hands. The FIR discloses that against the hand­loan of Rs.2,50,000/­, deceased had already paid an amount of Rs.3,50,000/­. Still this applicant and his associates were demanding Rs.2,50,000/­ more from the deceased along­with interest at the rate of Rs.2500/­ per month. Apart from that, against the execution of stamp paper of Rs.100/­, he was not paid the amount invested by him in the Bhishi and an amount of Rs.1,15,000/­ was not paid to him and it was recovered towards interest. Since facts of this cited case are altogether different with the case at hands, with due respect the law laid down therein is not helpful to applicant. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n10. As discussed earlier, Criminal Anticipatory Bail Application No.17/2019 filed by him is already rejected by this Court on merits. The rule of parity is not applicable to this applicant as other accused are released on regular bail and not on anticipatory bail. His presence is required for custodial interrogation. There is no change in circumstances. Hence the order follows:­ \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER Application is rejected. (Order is dictated and pronounced in the open Court) \r\n---order-ends---\r\nSatara (R.D.Deshpande) Dt.18/04/2019. Additional Sessions Judge, Satara."
