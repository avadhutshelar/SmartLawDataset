  "processedText": "ORDER BELOW EXH.01 IN CRI. BAIL APPLN. NO. 55/2019 Baburao Jyotiram Bhawar Vs. State of Maharashtra \r\n---header-ends---\r\nThis is an application for regular bail as per section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Heard advocate Mr. D. M. Barge for applicant. He submitted that in Crime No.325/2018 registered with Koregaon Police Station for the offences punishable under sections 411 etc. read with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, applicant is behind the bars since 18/01/2019. He was remanded in police custody till 25/01/2019 and since then he is in Magisterial custody. Part of his custodial interrogation is over. Nothing could be recovered at his instance during his custodial interrogation. He is falsely implicated at the instance of one Child­ in­conflict­with law. He is local resident and the sole earning member in the family. He is ready to furnish surety to the satisfaction of this Court and is also ready to obey with all the conditions those may be imposed upon him. His entire family is dependent upon him. Therefore he prayed that by imposing certain conditions, applicant may be released on bail. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2. APP Mr. Muke by filing his say at Exh.6 strongly resisted the application. He submitted that applicant came to be arranged since he has knowingly received the stolen property. He is the gold­smith. It seems that he is habitual offender. He is involved in similar offences with Rahimatpur and Koregaon Police Stations. Investigation is in progress. If he is released on bail then he is likely to tamper with the evidence of prosecution. Therefore he submitted that application may be rejected. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3. After going through the FIR dated 13/11/2018, it is seen that it is against unknown person. During the investigation and as per the police papers, one Child­in­conflict­with­law came to be arrested and he has spoken about the role of this applicant in the commission of offence. However, after his arrest, applicant was in the custody of police for about one week and since then he is in Magisterial custody. Nothing could be recovered at his instance. All the offences levelled against him are triable by the JMFC. Those are not punishable with death or imprisonment for life or imprisonment of more than seven years. He is local resident and happens to be the sole earning member in his family. He has furnished his address proof in the form of certificate issued by the Grampanchayat, Kinhai, Taluka – Koregaon. He has also produced on record his ADHAR Card which discloses his permanent address to be Peth Kinhai, Taluka – Koregaon, District – Satara. When he has already undergone custodial interrogation then no purpose of the prosecution would be served by keeping him behind the bars for an inordinate period. If some conditions are imposed then it would serve the purpose of prosecution. Hence the order follows :­ \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER 1 Application is allowed. 2 In Crime No. 325/2018 registered with Koregaon Police Station for the offences punishable under sections 411 etc. read with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, applicant Baburao Jyotiram Bhawar, be released on bail upon his executing P.R.
