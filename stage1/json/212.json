State of Maharashtra) CNR : MHST01­000121­2019 \r\n---header-ends---\r\n1) Present application is filed by the applicant under section 438 of Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 apprehending his arrest under C.R. no. 01/2019, registered at Koregaon police station, at the instance of Nitin Kushaba Lavangare, for alleged commission of offences punishable under sections 326 and 506 r/w. 34 of Indian Penal Code, 1860 and also sections 3(1)(r)(s), 3(2)(va) and 6 of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and section 7(1)(d) of Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2) It is contended by the applicant\u0027s advocate that, FIR is false and frivolously filed against this applicant and he has got no concern with any of the incidences comprising the FIR. It is contended that, allegations against this applicant are of having called the accused by his caste name of \u0027Chambhar\u0027 and of having raised alarm of not sparing the informant. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3) It is contended that, said allegations against this accused are false and frivolously incorporated merely to implicate this applicant as he happens to be husband of Madhuri, alleged to have inflicted stab injury on the informant. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4) It is contended that, the informant was never stabbed, even by Madhuri. The said allegations would be unbelievable as the informant himself mentions in the FIR of about more than 4, 5 persons, known to the informant, were present over there. It is contended that, in such circumstances, no person could dare to commit such offence. It is further contended that, informant is a body builder and Madhuri is thin slim, therefore also, it is impossible for this accused to stab the informant. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5) It is further contended that, present FIR is falsely and frivolously lodged to counter blast the FIR no. 357/2018 filed by this applicant\u0027s wife Madhuri against present informant at Koregaon police station for having outraged her modesty and behaved with her inappropriately on 28/12/2018. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6) It is contended that, the incidence against Madhuri was committed by this informant on 28/12/2018 at about 5:30 p.m. and Madhuri had promptly lodged her FIR against this informant on the same day at 8:00 p.m. Madhuri had narrated the incident occurred in her FIR about this informant harassing her since her spinster days. This informant harboured one sided love against Madhuri, asked her for marriage; inspite of refusal to marry with him, informant had been continuously harassing her. On 28/12/2018, this informant had spoken with Madhuri and caught hold of her left hand, in the manner that she would feel ashamed. Hence, Madhuri had lodged FIR no. 357/2018 against this informant. Present FIR is counter blast to the said complaint lodged by Madhuri. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n7) It is contended that, FIR can be seen to be false even from the informant\u0027s own conduct of travelling all the way about more than 25 kms. from Kinhai to Satara and getting admitted in a hospital specialized in Neurological ailments, whereas the informant\u0027s case allegedly involved of stab wound. There are many specialized hospital in Koregaon, just about 7 kms. from Kinhai. Informant got admitted in the hospital known to me, sought false certificate merely to harass this accused. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n8) It is also contended that, the medical certificate issued by the concerned doctor from the said Yashwant Hospital, can also be seen as forged and fabricated as the date of admission mention on it carries interpolation/overwriting. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n9) It is also contended that, the informant has been visiting Courts since 02/01/2019, he is hail and healthy, did not suffer any injury and has lodged false complaint. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n10) It is contended that, the FIR can be seen false for the reason that allegations are of being stabbed with the knife and informant\u0027s states of his nephew removing the knife from the informant\u0027s body. In such circumstances, nothing reveals from the investigation records as to how the knife is seized by the police. The seizure of knife is unexplained and is shown to have been recovered even before arresting Madhuri under this FIR. It is accordingly contended that, informant did not suffer any injury and the knife is planted in the investigation merely to harass the accused. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n11) It is contended that, allegations against this accused are having uttered any castiest slur or of having insulted the informant as to his caste are false and frivolous. This accused did not assault the informant. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n12) It is also contended that, this applicant\u0027s wife Madhuri was harassed by the informant on 28/12/2018 for which Madhuri has lodged the FIR on the same day and informant has lodged false complaint on 01/01/2019 belatedly after four days. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n13) It is contended that, this accused\u0027s name was neither mentioned in the FIR, nor his presence was shown, in the incidences narrated in the FIR, nor any role attributed to him at all. It is contended that, present applicant has been roped in the offence as a result of the informant\u0027s supplementary statement dated 04/01/2019, in which informant for the first time names this applicant/accused. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n14) It is contended that, the informant had initially lodged a false complaint and has been daily improvising and aggravating his complaint merely to harass this applicant. This applicant is serving in the Armed forces for last 15 years, annually visits his home town for a month or two, is not much aware of his wife\u0027s neighbours at her parental village; therefore there would be no reason for applicant to know the applicant\u0027s caste. Moreover, this applicant has neither abused, insulted or humiliated the informant on his caste, nor has even quarreled, assaulted or injured the informant. Therefore, applicant is falsely implicated in the FIR, hence is required to be protected by grant of pre­arrest bail. Accordingly, protection is contended. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n15) Applicant\u0027s advocate further contended that, the informant\u0027s FIR being false and frivolous complaint, filed as counter blast the Madhuri\u0027s genuine FIR, even otherwise the applicant being roped in the incident about after 7 to 8 days of the alleged incidence, bar of section 18 or 18­A of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act 1989, shall not apply. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n16) In support of his contention, the applicant\u0027s advocate has placed reliance on the following rulings :­ i) Order dated 09/01/2019 passed by the Hon\u0027ble Bombay High Court in Cr.A. No. 965/2017 in the matter of Sapana Korde nee Ketaki A. Ghodinde Vs. The State of Maharashtra; ii) Order dated 31/10/2018 passed by the Hon\u0027ble Bombay High Court in Criminal Appeal No. 1173/2018 in the matter of Sunil Mandevrao Thombre (Bavdhankar) and others Vs. The State of Maharashtra and another; iii) Order dated 11/10/2018 passed by the Hon\u0027ble Madhya Pradesh High Court in Cr.A.No. 7295/2018 in the matter Atendra Singh Rawat Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh; iv) Order dated 21/12/2018 passed by the Hon\u0027ble High Court Calcutta in C.R.M. No. 8302/2018 in the matter Debjyoti Bhattacharyya Vs. The State of West Bengal; \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n17) Bail application is resisted by the APP by filing say at Exh. 13 on the grounds that, the informant belongs to Hindu \u0027Chambhar\u0027 community recognized as \u0027Scheduled Caste\u0027. Accused have abused and insulted the informant on his caste in a market being a public place in a public view. Madhuri inflicted stab injury on the informant, from his back. Said assault could have risked the informant\u0027s life, in case he would not have been rendered timely medical aid. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n18) It is contended that, the informant was initially taken to the Government hospital and then admitted in private hospital at Satara. Investigation in the matter is continuing, other accused are to be arrested, vehicles are to be seized. The fact this accused\u0027s wife stabbed the informant and all the accused having humiliated the informant as to his caste, in a public place and in public view, accused cannot be protected by grant of pre­arrest bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n19) It is further contended that, in view of the bar under section 18­A of the Special Act, pre­arrest bail application itself is not maintainable, therefore also, applicant/accused cannot be protected by grant of pre­arrest bail. Accordingly, bail is resisted. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n20) Bail application is also resisted by the informant by filing say at Exh. 14 on the grounds that, the informant was assaulted after a conspiracy hatched in this accused\u0027s family. It is contended that, the only dispute between the informant and the accused\u0027s family was of quarrels having taken place about 3 to 4 years back at Ganeshwadi, as a result of the informant\u0027s motorcycle colliding with this applicant\u0027s motorcycle. Said dispute was resolved at that time at village level. However, accused\u0027s family harboured enmity of it. \u003d6\u003d \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n21) It is also contended that, the conspiracy can be even seen from the fact that, the accused male family members were keeping guard near the spot of incidence and fled away on motorcycles immediately thereafter. Accused\u0027s family forwarded the lady from their family to assault the informant and to scuttle the probable complaint immediately rushed to file a false FIR alleging the commission of offence punishable under section 354 of Indian Penal Code, 1860 against this accused. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n22) It is further contended that, informant stays in the neighbouring of the parental home of this accused\u0027s wife and having fields adjacent to this accused\u0027s father­in­law\u0027s field; therefore accused knew informant\u0027s caste and community. Irrespective of it, accused insulted the informant and humiliated him using very filthy language. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n23) It is further contended that, informant was assaulted on 28/12/2018, however cognizance of his complaint was taken only on 01/01/2019. The complaint was not recorded as per the informant\u0027s narration, hence informant had lodged a complaint with the office of Superintendent of Police, Satara on 03/01/2019, alleging against the concerned police, refusing to take the informant\u0027s complaint in his verbatim. It is contended that, the police acted in the high handed manner, under the accused\u0027s family\u0027s pressure and recorded complaint merely under section 324 and 506 of Indian Penal Code, 1860 inspite of the incidences involving the commission of offence punishable under section 307 of Indian Penal Code, 1860. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n24) It is accordingly contended that, FIR no. 357/2018 being registered by this accused against informant is false and filed merely to scuttle present FIR lodged by this informant against the present accused. It is contended that, accused and \u003d7\u003d witness\u0027s safety and security is at risk, hence accused need not be granted pre­arrest bail. It is also contended that, the bail application is not maintainable in view of the bar of section 18­A of the Special Act. Accordingly, bail is resisted. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n25) Upon hearing the applicant\u0027s advocate, the APP, the informant\u0027s advocate, perusing the say filed on record and also the other investigation papers produced on record, it appears that, allegations against this accused are of having insulted and humiliated the informant as to his caste in a market place, in public view. Allegations of stabbing are not against this applicant/accused. It is even the informant\u0027s allegation of his complaint not being recorded as per his narration. However, informant\u0027s said grievance would be directed against the police. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n26) Material at hand also reveals past disputes between both the sides. On one hand, it is the informant\u0027s contention of the dispute pertaining to motorcycle accident 3 to 4 years back and the present assault being as a result of that enmity. As against this, it is present accused\u0027s case of the informant hovering around this applicant\u0027s wife since her spinster days, asking her for marriage, on refusal time and again harassing her and catching hold of her hand, lastly on 28/12/2018. It is the informant as well as this applicant/accused\u0027s contention of their FIR being genuine and the other party\u0027s FIR being a counter blast. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n27) It is also a matter of record that the weapon knife is shown recovered, even before effectuating any arrest under this FIR. In such circumstances, it appears that, no seizure or recovery remains to be done at the instance of this accused. APP\u0027s contention of recovering the vehicles is concerned, but naturally would not be at the instance of this accused, as there are no allegations of this accused using any motorcycle. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n28) In the matter of Sunil Thombre (Supra), Hon\u0027ble Bombay High Court was pleased to protect the applicant/accused by grant of pre­arrest bail in respect of incidence dated 20/08/2018 i.e. after the introduction of section 18­A in the Special Act, on the grounds that the informant\u0027s caste was not disclosed in the FIR. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n29) In the matter of Atendra (Supra), Hon\u0027ble Madhya Pradesh High Court was pleased to protect the said applicant/accused, observing that the allegations in the FIR did not match with the ingredients of section 3(1)(w)(i) of the Special Act. While granting the pre­arrest bail, the Hon\u0027ble High Court had even taken into consideration the provisions of section 18­A (2) of the Special Act. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n30) In the matter of Debjyoti (Supra), Hon\u0027ble High Court discussing at length the provisions of section18­A of the Special Act, was pleased to protect the said applicant/accused by grant of pre­arrest bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n31) Similarly, in the matter of Sapna Korde (Supra), Hon\u0027ble High Court Bombay, considering the complainant\u0027s objection under section 18­A of the Special Act, was pleased to protect the applicant accused by grant of pre­arrest bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n32) In the case in hand, it is matter of record that, the informant alleges occurrence to be dated 28/12/2018, but FIR is lodged on 01/01/2019, the informant\u0027s complaint improvising in his supplementary statement dated 04/01/2019, there is no injury certificate issued by any Government hospital. There indeed appears some over writings in the dates, in the injury certificate issued by a private hospital. Neither this applicant/accused was named nor any role was attributed to him in the FIR. Perusal of the informant\u0027s Farad­bayan dated 01/01/2019, carries medical officer\u0027s endorsement of the informant being able to give statement. No reason is submitted for omitting this applicant/accused\u0027s name in the said initial statement. This applicant/accused\u0027s name is involved in the offence 3 days thereafter. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n33) Thus, taking into consideration the totality of circumstances, the ratio\u0027s in the cited rulings, the complaints and cross complaints, weapon already being recovered, it appears that, custodial investigation would not be required, the frequent improvements in the informant\u0027s complaint, it appears that, bar of section 18 or 18­A of the Special Act would not be applicable to the case in hand. However, APP and informant\u0027s apprehensions are to be taken care of. Hence, the following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER 1) Criminal Bail Application no. 12/2019, is allowed. 2) In the event of arrest of applicant Vijay Mahadeo Ghadge, he be released on bail under C.R. no. 01/2019, registered at Koregaon police station, on his furnishing personal bond of Rs. 25,000/­ (Rs. Twenty Five Thousand) with atleast one or more surety/ies, to make up the bond amount, on the following terms and conditions :­ a) Applicant shall attend the concerned police station twice in a week preferably on every Monday and Friday in between 11:00 a.m. to 2.00 p.m. b) Applicant shall not tamper with any evidence. c) Applicant shall not directly or indirectly make any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the case so as to dissuade him from disclosing such facts to the court or to any Police Officer. d) Accused shall make available himself and co­operate for interrogation by Police Officer as and when required. e) Any default of above conditions shall render the bail to be cancelled automatically. \r\n---order-ends---\r\n(Y. H. Ameta) Place : Satara Special Judge Date : 18th January, 2019. Satara"
