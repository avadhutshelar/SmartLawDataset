Applicants, namely, Yogesh Namdeo Kale, Ashpak Dastgir Shaikh, Devidas Kacharu Shinde and Lakshmikant Keshavrao Patil by this application under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure pray for bail in C.R.No.549 of 2018 registered with Phaltan Rural Police Station under Sections 420 r/w 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n02. Perused the application and say filed by the prosecution at Exh.9. Gone through the investigation papers. Heard learned Advocate for the applicant and the learned A.P.P. for the State. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n03. It is vehemently argued by the learned Advocate for the applicants that, applicants are in MCR since 12/01/2019. They are falsely involved in the alleged offence. Custodial interrogation of the applicants is not necessary. Applicants are ready to abide any condition if so imposed by the Court and will not misuse their liberty in any manner. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n04. Per contra, it is vehemently argued by learned A.P.P. that, if applicants are released on bail, there is every possibility of their absconding and repetition of commission of similar nature of offence. Applicants are resident of Nashik District and will misuse their liberty. Investigation is in progress. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n05. I have gone through the investigation papers. From the complaint of Dnyaneshwar Subhash Pore dated 21/12/2018, it reveals that, on 03/12/2018 at about 04:05 p.m. three to four unknown persons came in a Mahindra Xylo vehicle at Petrol Pump and filled diesel of Rs.200/­. One person got down from the Xylo and told Akshay Pisal that the said person was required some money to make payment to his labours and all ATM are closed and he is in urgent need of money. The person got down from the vehicle obtained Rs.10,200/­ from Akshay Pisal and gave him Master Card No.xxxx3275, same card was swiped to the extent of amount of Rs.10,200/­ on a swipe machine of Veriphone company and when swipe machine was handed over to the card holder to enter the pin, he deliberately cancelled the transaction and as such the unknown person cheated the labour of complainant to the extent of Rs.10,200/­. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n06. First of all, it is necessary to mention here that, alleged incident taken place on 03/12/2018 and complaint was lodged on 21/12/2018. There is delay in lodging the complaint. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n07. From the say of learned A.P.P. at Exh.9 it reveals that, applicants are resident of Nashik District and having history of previous crimes. Investigation is in progress. Applicants will not co­ operate with the Police for investigation if they are released on bail. Applicants will tamper the investigation and possibility of their absconding cannot be ruled out. Applicants will repeat similar kind of offence. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n08. On perusal of remand papers dated 12/01/2019, it reveals that, on 12/01/2019, applicants were produced before learned Magistrate of Phaltan. MCR was sought by Police and the same was granted. Bail application of applicants was rejected by learned Magistrate by observing that, applicants are resident of  Nashik District. Possibility of their absconding cannot be ruled out. Other offences are registered against applicants. Investigation is not completed. If applicants are released on bail, possibility cannot be overruled that they will commit similar kind of offence. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n09. From the record it reveals that yet charge­sheet is not filed against applicants. Applicants are in MCR from 12/01/2019. The modus of applicants is of cheating by use of Debit/Credit cards. Record not indicates that the Debit/Credit card of the applicants are not seized. If Debit/Credit cards of the applicants are seized there is no possibility that, applicants will repeat similar type of offence. The punishment provided for the alleged offence against applicants is may extend to 7 years and shall also be liable to fine and triable by Magistrate. Applicants are in MCR from 12/01/2019 means applicants are in Magisterial custody from last 66 days from the date when they were first produced before the Court. In such circumstances, applicants are also entitled for default bail. True that, all applicants are residents of Nashik District, however just on that count, in my mind, their bail cannot be rejected. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n10. Considering the nature of offence, considering the punishment provided for alleged offence, keeping in mind that applicants are in MCR since last 66 days, considering that applicants are even otherwise entitled for default bail, keeping in mind that the charges levelled against the applicants are triable by Judicial Magistrate, First Class, I am of the view that, it would be just, proper and judicious to release the applicants on bail by imposing some conditions on them. Hence, I proceed to pass following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER 1. Criminal Bail Application No.121/2019 is allowed. 2. Applicants No.1 to 4, namely, Yogesh Namdeo Kale, Ashpak Dastgir Shaikh, Devidas Kacharu Shinde and Lakshmikant Keshavrao Patil be released on bail on executing PB and SB of Rs.15,000/­ each. 3.

If it is noticed that, applicants are disobeying the condition by non attending the Police Station, that should be the ground for cancellation of bail of applicants. \r\n---order-ends---\r\nSatara.
