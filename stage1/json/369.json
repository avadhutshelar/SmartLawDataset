Atish Machindra Sonawane Age­22 years, Occu­Agriculture 2. Dinesh Shripati Sonawane Age­30 years, Occu­Labour work Both R/at Kasurdi, Sonawanevasti, Tal. Daund, Dist Pune .... Applicants V/s. State of Maharashtra, Through Incharge of Yawat Police Station, Tal­Daund, Dist­Pune … Opponent \r\n---header-ends---\r\nORDER BELOW BAIL APPLICATION EXH­1 1] The applicants (accused Nos. 1\u0026 5) have filed present bail application for anticipatory bail under section 438 of Criminal Procedure Code in Crime No. 1042/2018 registered with Yawat Police Station, for offence punishable under section 326, 324, 323, 143, 147, 148, 149, 504, 506 of Indian Penal Code. \r\n---background-ends---\r\nThe allegation against the applicants and other accused persons are that on 16­10­2018 about 7.30 p.m. they have assaulted informant Rahul Sonawane and his family members by means of sticks, iron rod, piece of brick and with fist and kicks, and caused grievous hurt to informant Rahul Sonawane and simple hurts to other members of his family. Specific allegation against the applicants are that they used iron rod and stick while causing injuries to informant Rahul. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n2] The applicants stated that, false and delayed FIR is filed only to implicate to them. Applicant No. 1 is under going training for joining police force and he is maintaining his parents. They are having permanent resident within the jurisdiction of this court, therefore they would not abscond. They requested to release them on anticipatory bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3] The application is opposed by I.O. and APP on the ground that the offense are very serious, they used deadly weapons which are to be seized. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4] I heard Advocate S.J.Salve for the applicants and APP Smt. S.K. Naik for the prosecution. Perused the police papers made available by APP. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5] It appears from the police papers that informant Rahul sustained grievous hurt i.e. fracture on his left ulna, and other family members of informant sustained simple injuries. There are specific allegation in the FIR that applicant no.1 gave blows of rod on the hand of informant Rahul, and applicant no.2 gave blows of stick on back and waist of Rahul. In the injury certificate fracture of left ulna , and blunt trauma on lumber region on the body of informant Rahul are shown. Thus prima facie material on record point out commission of offence under section 326 of IPC, and both the applicants used stick and iron rod while causing injuries to informant. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6] The submission made by learned Advocate for applicants that, due to filing of compliant by applicant no.1 against informant and his family members for theft of sand, present false FIR is filed. However at this stage prima facie material points out the involvement of present applicants in commission of offence under section 326 r.w.34 of IPC. The other accused in this crime who are family members of the applicants are released on anticipatory bail in Criminal Bail Application No.818/2018 and 885/2018 by this court. However, their role was only that they assaulted informant and his family members by fist and kicks, and no deadly weapons were used by them. As such in my view the applicants are not entitled for parity with other co­accused who are released on anticipatory bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n7] Present applicants are absconding since the day of incident. The delay of two days in filing FIR cannot be given over importance particularly when the informant was admitted in the hospital. The weapons i.e. iron rod and stick used by applicants accused are to be seized from them. Therefore their custody with the investigating officer is necessary for investigation. Hence in my view the applicants are not entitled for anticipatory bail. In the result, I pass following order:­ \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER The Cri Bail Application No.21/2019 is rejected. \r\n---order-ends---\r\nsdxxx Date : 01­02­2019 ( N.B. Shinde ) Addl.
