  "processedText": "ORDER BELOW EXH.1 IN CRIMINAL BAIL APPLICATION No. 123 of 2019 (Sachin Baliram Khude Vs. State of Maharashtra) CNR : MHST01­000621­2019 \r\n---header-ends---\r\n1) This application is under Sec. 439 of Code of Criminal Procedure filed by applicant­accused in C.R.No. 102 of 2019 registered with Satara City Police Station. 2) Accusation is that, applicant alongwith others attempted to commit murder of the informant Amol Rajendra Chavan. They brutally assaulted the informant by means of wooden logs and stones. In said assault the informant sustained grievous injuries on his person. The offence was registered against the applicant and others for the offence punishable under Sec. 307, 143, 146, 147, 148, 149, 323, 504, 506 of Indian Penal Code. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2) Accused was arrested in above mentioned crime on 11.02.2019. The said crime is registered in respect of the offence punishable under Section 307 of Indian Penal Code. Accused is at present in Magisterial Custody. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3) It is stated that, FIR is false and without strong base, complainant has falsely implicated the applicant in the crime, applicant is permanent resident of given address, he is innocent, he was in police custody since 11.02.2019 to 15.02.2019. Applicant undertakes to abide by the conditions imposed on him while granting the bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3) The prosecution has filed its say at Exh. 5. It is contended that, applicant and other accused have used deadly weapons, the injury certificate shows in all 6 injuries on the person of informant and he is still admitted in the hospital so also police have seized wooden stick at the instance of applicant. It is also stated that, other 8 to 9 associates of applicant are absconding, applicant is drunkard and in case of bail he may commit same kind of offence. Hence, prayed for rejection of the application. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4) Heard learned Advocate for the applicant­accused. He submitted that, applicant is innocent, falsely implicated by the complainant and has no connection with the crime, therefore prayed for grant of bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5) It is submitted on behalf of prosecution that, other accused persons are involved in this crime. If applicant is released on bail, possibility of pressurizing the witnesses cannot be ruled out. Further it is submitted that, other associates of the applicant are absconding and investigation is still in progress. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5) On perusal of FIR, there seems direct involvement of applicant in the crime. Though the reason is mentioned for not granting the bail that, other accused are absconding, same cannot be the sole ground for rejecting the application. Considering the nature of offence and the manner in which it is committed, there is possibility of tampering with the witnesses of prosecution. Therefore, I am not inclined to release the accused on bail at this stage. Investigation admittedly is under progress. The grounds submitted that, accused is only earning member and having small kids, cannot be considered at this stage of investigation. Hence, the order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nO R D E R 1) Criminal Bail Application no. 123 of 2019, is rejected. \r\n---order-ends---\r\n(B.S.Wavre) Place : Satara Addl.
