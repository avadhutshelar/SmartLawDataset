    "text": "1) Present bail application is preferred by the applicants under section 439 of Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 seeking their release from arrest, under C.R. no. 475/2018, registered at Phaltan City Police Station, at the instance of Vijay Sadashiv Madane, for alleged commission of offence punishable under section 420 r/w. 34 of Indian Penal Code, 1860. \r\n---header-ends---\r\n2) It is contended by the accused advocate that, FIR was registered on 06/12/2018, against unknown accused. However, present applicants/accused have been falsely arrested, inspite of having no complicity in the offence. It is contended that, accused have been arrested on mere suspicions. Accused\u0027s ATM, debit and credit cards are also seized by the police. It is contended that, accused are arrested on 17/12/2018. Ld. Magistrate has rejected the applicant/accused\u0027s bail application vide it\u0027s order dated 14/01/2019 on the grounds that the offence is serious in nature and the accused are not resident from within the jurisdiction of that Court, and also apprehending repetition of similar offence. It is contended that, allegations against the accused are of having cheated, using the ATM/debit and credit cards, but the said cards are seized by the police and there cannot be possibility of repetition of similar offences. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3) It is further contended that accused are arrested on 17/12/2018, however investigation is not completed as yet, charge­sheet is not filed. Therefore, accused cannot be kept arrested indifinately. Accordingly, bail is contended. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4) Bail application is resisted by the APP by filing say at Exh. 6 on the grounds that, accused are habitual in nature, operating similar modus and cheating people, various offences are registered against this accused in many police stations, including Nashik district, Phaltan rural police station, Wathar police station and also at Jejuri police station. It is contended that, the amount of Rs. 5,200/­ for which informant was cheated is recovered, but releasing the accused on bail, may lead to repetition of similar offences. Accordingly, bail is resisted. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5) Upon perusing FIR, hearing the APP and the accused\u0027s advocate, it appears that, offence is registered on 06/12/2018 and the copy of remand report dated 18/12/2018 annexed alongwith the bail application reveals the accused to be arrested on 17/12/2018. The offence punishable under section 420 of Indian Penal Code, 1860 entails punishment which may extend upto 7 years. In such circumstances, investigation ought to have been completed till now and charge­sheet ought to have been filed. However, nothing is brought on record by the APP about the investigation being completed or the charge­sheet being filed. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6) That apart, it is matter of record that the modus of the accused is of cheating by use of debit/credit cards. The same are seized under personal search of the accused in respect of the offence registered at Wathar police station. Therefore, the apprehension of repetition of similar offence, atleast as of now does not survive. In such circumstances, it appears that, sufficient time has been consumed for investigation in the matter. It is uncertain as to how much time shall be consumed for trial to be initiated \u0026 conclude. Therefore, it appears that, no much purpose shall be achieved by keeping accused arrested any further. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n7) Further, nothing being brought on record about the charge­sheet being filed, in such circumstances the accused is arrested on 17/12/2018 and in view of the fact that, the offence alleged is punishable upto 7 years only, it appears that, today as on 11th March 2019, the investigation agency has consumed more than 84 days, thus, it appears that, accused are also entitled for default bail. Hence, the following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER 1) Criminal Bail Application no. 60/2019, is allowed. 2) Applicant/accused no.1 Vijay Dhondiram Suryavanshi, no. 2 Yogesh Namdeo Kale, no. 3 Nilesh Anant Bhide, no. 4 Ashpak Dastgir Shaikh, no. 5 Devidas Kacharu Shinde and no. 6 Lakshmikant Keshavrao Patil, be released on bail, from their arrest under C.R. no. 475/2018, registered at Phaltan City Police Station, on their executing P.B. \u0026 S.B. of Rs. 15,000/­ each, on following terms and conditions; a) Accused shall cause his attendance twice at the concerned police station preferably on every Tuesday and Saturday at any time in between 11.00 a.m. to 2.00 p.m., till further orders. b) Accused shall not tamper with any evidence. c) Accused shall not directly or indirectly make any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the case so as to dissuade him from disclosing such facts to the court or to any Police Officer. d) Accused shall make available themselves and co­ operate for interrogation by Police Officer as and when required. e) Any default of above conditions shall render the bail to be cancelled automatically. f) Compliance before lower Court. \r\n---order-ends---\r\n(Y.

Accused\u0027s ATM, debit and credit cards are also seized by the police. It is contended that, accused are arrested on 17/12/2018. Ld. Magistrate has rejected the applicant/accused\u0027s bail application vide it\u0027s order dated 14/01/2019 on the grounds that the offence is serious in nature and the accused are not resident from within the jurisdiction of that Court, and also apprehending repetition of similar offence. It is contended that, allegations against the accused are of having cheated, using the ATM/debit and credit cards, but the said cards are seized by the police and there cannot be possibility of repetition of similar offences. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3) It is further contended that accused are arrested on 17/12/2018, however investigation is not completed as yet, charge­sheet is not filed. Therefore, accused cannot be kept arrested indifinately. Accordingly, bail is contended. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4) Bail application is resisted by the APP by filing say at Exh. 6 on the grounds that, accused are habitual in nature, operating similar modus and cheating people, various offences are registered against this accused in many police stations, including Nashik district, Phaltan rural police station, Wathar police station and also at Jejuri police station. It is contended that, the amount of Rs. 5,200/­ for which informant was cheated is recovered, but releasing the accused on bail, may lead to repetition of similar offences. Accordingly, bail is resisted. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5) Upon perusing FIR, hearing the APP and the accused\u0027s advocate, it appears that, offence is registered on 06/12/2018 and the copy of remand report dated 18/12/2018 annexed alongwith the bail application reveals the accused to be arrested on 17/12/2018. The offence punishable under section 420 of Indian Penal Code, 1860 entails punishment which may extend upto 7 years. In such circumstances, investigation ought to have been completed till now and charge­sheet ought to have been filed. However, nothing is brought on record by the APP about the investigation being completed or the charge­sheet being filed. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6) That apart, it is matter of record that the modus of the accused is of cheating by use of debit/credit cards. The same are seized under personal search of the accused in respect of the offence registered at Wathar police station. Therefore, the apprehension of repetition of similar offence, atleast as of now does not survive. In such circumstances, it appears that, sufficient time has been consumed for investigation in the matter. It is uncertain as to how much time shall be consumed for trial to be initiated \u0026 conclude. Therefore, it appears that, no much purpose shall be achieved by keeping accused arrested any further. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n7) Further, nothing being brought on record about the charge­sheet being filed, in such circumstances the accused is arrested on 17/12/2018 and in view of the fact that, the offence alleged is punishable upto 7 years only, it appears that, today as on 11th March 2019, the investigation agency has consumed more than 84 days, thus, it appears that, accused are also entitled for default bail. Hence, the following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER 1) Criminal Bail Application no. 60/2019, is allowed. 2) Applicant/accused no.1 Vijay Dhondiram Suryavanshi, no. 2 Yogesh Namdeo Kale, no. 3 Nilesh Anant Bhide, no. 4 Ashpak Dastgir Shaikh, no. 5 Devidas Kacharu Shinde and no. 6 Lakshmikant Keshavrao Patil, be released on bail, from their arrest under C.R. no. 475/2018, registered at Phaltan City Police Station, on their executing P.B. \u0026 S.B. of Rs. 15,000/­ each, on following terms and conditions; a) Accused shall cause his attendance twice at the concerned police station preferably on every Tuesday and Saturday at any time in between 11.00 a.m. to 2.00 p.m., till further orders. b) Accused shall not tamper with any evidence. c) Accused shall not directly or indirectly make any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the case so as to dissuade him from disclosing such facts to the court or to any Police Officer. d) Accused shall make available themselves and co­ operate for interrogation by Police Officer as and when required. e) Any default of above conditions shall render the bail to be cancelled automatically. f) Compliance before lower Court. \r\n---order-ends---\r\n(Y.
