CNR NO: MHST 01000597­2019 \r\n---header-ends---\r\n1) This the bail application moved by applicant­accused in S.C.C.No. 21/2017, pending in the Court of Judicial Magistrate, F.C., Wai, for bail as per provision under Section 439 of Cr.P.C. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2) According to accused, original complainant had filed Summary Cr.Case No. 24/2007 before J.M.F.C. Medha, but the J.M.F.C. Medha has no jurisdiction to try and entertain the matter hence complaint was ordered to be returned to the complainant for its presentation in proper Court. Accordingly, complainant filed it in the Court of J.M.F.C. Wai vide S.C.C.No. 21/2017. During the pendency, non­bailable warrant came to be issued against the applicant­accused. On 12.09.2019 applicant­accused appeared before concerned Court and prayed to cancel the non­bailable warrant, however, J.M.F.C. Wai rejected the application and applicant was taken in custody. Hence, this application. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3) Application is opposed on the ground that, present case is for the offence pun/u/S. 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act. As accused remained absent since last 10 years in the matter, J.M.F.C. has rejected the application and applicant was taken into custody as the matter is pending due to absence of the accused. Hence, order passed by J.M.F.C. needs no interference. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4) Heard learned Advocate Shri. C.S.Redekar for the applicant­accused and learned A.P.P. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5) It is submitted on behalf applicant is that, he is ready to furnish bail, he was not aware about the transfer of case to J.M.F.C. Court Wai, therefore, remained absent and warrant came to be issued against him. It is further submitted that, accused was sue­moto appeared before Court on getting information, however, he was not granted bail. It is submitted on behalf of the prosecution that, condition be imposed to furnish surety of heavy amount and to furnish solvency. Considering the submissions I have to mention that, as the order is passed to issue Non­bailable warrant against the accused and warrant was issued, it means that the earlier surety furnished by the accused stands forfeited. It seems that, accused has not deposited the amount of surety bond of which he has committed the breach. I agree that, offence is bailable one. Record shows that accused was not attending the Court, therefore, trial of the case was delayed. Hence, submission by learned A.P.P can be accepted. Accused may be directed to furnish surety of heavy amount. Hence, I pass following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nO R D E R 1) Cri. Misc. Application No.116/2019 is allowed subject to condition that he shall deposit the amount of surety bond earlier furnished before J.M.F.C. Medha or Wai. 2) Applicant­accused be released on bail on his furnishing personal bond of Rs.25,000/­ with one or more surety/ies. 3) Bail in trial Court. \r\n---order-ends---\r\n(B.S.Wavre) Place : Satara Addl.
