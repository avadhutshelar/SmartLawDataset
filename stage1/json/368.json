Bail Appln No.20/2019 ORDER BELOW EXH. 1 IN CRIMINAL BAIL APPLICATION NO.20 OF 2019 CNR – MHPU14000102-2019 \r\n---header-ends---\r\n[1] Present application is filed by the applicant- accused Sunil Dadasaheb Saste claiming anticipatory bail u/s. 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure-1973, against whom Crime No. 36 of 2019, is registered in Baramati City police station (District–Pune ), for having committed offences punishable U/ss. 353, 504, 506 r/w 34 of the I.P.C. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n[2] It is prosecution case, incident took place on 08/01/2019. It is prosecution case, informant public servant had given some directions regarding updation of way bridge to the Malegaon Cooperative Sugar Factory. On 8/1/2019 at about 2.04 pm accused came in the office with another person and in the course of dialogue attempted to use criminal force against the informant. Person who was with the applicant-accused also tried to use criminal force against informant. Applicant-accused threatened informant and thereby obstructed him from discharging duty as public servant. It is prosecution case, on getting information of the offence, case is registered against the applicant accused and another. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[3] Learned Advocate Mr. More appearing for the applicant-accused submitted arguments in the line of application filed. In addition to it, he placed reliance upon the documentary evidence, to show though cases were filed against the applicant-accused now he is acquitted, applicant-accused is not member of the Malegaon Cooperative Sugar Factory and he required medical treatment for the injury sustained to the skull. He also submitted copy of application filed asking the office of the informant from where information was to be called. In addition to that, he placed reliance upon the ratio laid down in the following mentioned cases - 1. Vinesh Kumar V/s. State of Kerala, 2018 CRI L. J. (NOC) 531 (KER). 2. Santosh Kumar V/s. The State of M. P., MCRC-11286-2017 decided on 26/7/2017. 3. Gopal V/s. State, LAWS (MAD)-1988-9-24. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[4] Per contra, learned A.P.P. Mr. Joshi submitted arguments in the line of say (Exh.5) filed by the prosecution and strongly opposed request made by the applicant-accused. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[5] I have given anxious thought to the arguments advanced. I have also perused police papers produced for examination and documentary evidence produced by the accused. I have considered ratio laid down in the cited cases with reference to the facts of the present case. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[6] It is alleged applicant-accused committed offence punishable under sections 353, 504, 506 r/w 34 of I. P. C. It appears, investigation is in progress. Another accused is still not traced out by the police. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[7] It is well settled while considering bail application microscopic scrutiny of the evidence is not expected. Thus, when investigation is not completed and when prima facie it appears applicant-accused was in the office of the informant and some incident occurred. Submissions made in the present situation offence punishable under section 353 of I. P. C is not applicable, is not acceptable. [8] Even for sake of arguments it is accepted, relation between informant and the applicant-accused are not cordial, he requires medical treatment, even then it need to be seen whether apprehension expressed is reasonable. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[9] Coming to aforesaid point, it need to be taken into consideration major offence alleged to have committed is punishable under section 353 of I. P. C for which punishment is five years. Recently amendment is made in section 41 of the Code of the Criminal Procedure and it is made mandatory unless it is essential in such situation nobody should be arrested. It has not brought on the record by the accused that unnecessary investigating officer would arrest him. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[10] So far as ratio laid down in the cited cases is concerned , facts involved therein are different. Therefore, though there is no dispute pertaining to the ratio laid down in the cited cases, it cannot be made applicable to the facts of the present case as it is. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[11] Thus, in my conclusion, in given circumstances, case is not made out apprehension expressed is reasonable and/or request made is acceptable. [12] In the result, following order is passed :- \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER Request made by the accused Sunil Dadasaheb Saste to grant anticipatory bail against whom Crime No. 36 of 2019 is registered in Baramati City Police station, stands rejected. Accordingly, order is passed and Bail Application stands disposed of. \r\n---order-ends---\r\nBaramati ( R.B. Deshpande) 08.02.2019 Addl. Sessions Judge, Baramati.
