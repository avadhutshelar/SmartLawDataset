State of Maharashtra) CNR : MHST01­000559­2019 \r\n---header-ends---\r\n1) Present bail application is preferred by the applicants under section 439 of Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 seeking their release from their arrest under execution of non bailable warrant issued by Ld. J.M.F.C. Khandala in R.C.C. no. 06/2015. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2) It is contended by applicant\u0027s advocate that, accused are arrested under execution of NBW at the time the accused\u0027s preferred application for cancellation of said warrants. It is contended that, all offences are bailable in nature however, Ld. J.M.F.C.refused to grant bail to applicants. It is contended that, charge in the matter is already framed, absence was due to inadvertence. Bail application is rejected by Ld. J.M.F.C. only on the grounds of the apprehension of accused fleeing away again. It is contended that, accused undertakes to attend every date of hearing expedite the trial. Accordingly, bail is contended. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3) Bail application is resisted by the APP by filing say at Exh. 4 on the grounds that, accused are arrested in breach of conditions as per section 436(2) of Criminal Procedure Code, 1973, hence are not entitled for bail. It is contended that, in case of released on bail, they may abscond and protract the trial. Accordingly, bail is resisted. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4) Upon hearing the APP and applicant\u0027s advocate and perusing the papers, it appears that, applicants/accused are arrested under execution of NBW issued by the Ld. JMFC Khandala. Perusal of bail rejection order reveals that, charge is framed in the matter. However, it is uncertain as to the time to be consumed for completion of trial. All offences appear to be bailable in nature. In such circumstances, keeping the accused arrested pending the trial, would amount to punishment before trial, which is not justifiable. At the same time, APP\u0027s apprehensions shall also have to be considered for ensuring accused\u0027s presence at the hearing and facing the trial. The same can be secured by subjecting the accused to certain conditions. Hence, the following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nO R D E R 1) Criminal Bail Application no. 108/2019, is allowed; 2) Applicant no. 1 Babaso Mahadev Mane and no. Shivaji Babaso Mane, be released on bail from their arrest under execution of NBW issued in R.C.C. no. 06/2015 upon paying penalty of Rs.2,000/­ each (Rs.Two Thousand Hundred each); and executing personal bond of Rs. 25,000/­ each (Rs. Twenty Five Thousand) with atleast one or more local surety/ies, to make up the bail amount; on following terms \u0026 conditions; a) Applicants shall not tamper with evidence. b) Applicants shall not directly or indirectly make any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the case so as to dissuade him from disclosing such facts to the court or to any Police Officer. c) Applicants shall attend each and every date of hearing, failing which the bail granted herein shall automatically stand cancelled. d) Applicants shall provide their addresses of availability and operative mobile numbers to the concern police station. Accused shall always be available through their given mobile numbers. e) Compliance before lower Court. \r\n---order-ends---\r\n(Y. H. Ameta) Place : Satara Addl.
