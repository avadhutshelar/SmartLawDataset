  "processedText": "ORDER BELOW EXH.01 IN CRI. MISC. APPLN. NO. 164/2019 MHST01­000862­2019 Dhairyasheel Balaso Pawar etc.4 Vs. State of Maharashtra \r\n---header-ends---\r\nThis is an application for anticipatory bail as per section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Heard advocate Mr. Mardhekar for applicants. He submitted that Crime No.67/2019 is registered against these applicants with Satara Taluka Police Station for the offences punishable under sections 307 etc. read with section 149 of the Indian Penal Code. They are strongly apprehending their arrest in this Crime. According to him, the FIR lodged by one Ramdas Kadav against these applicants is false and concocted. \r\n---background-ends---\r\nIncident as alleged in the FIR never took place. Out of the political rivalry and merely as a counter to the FIR lodged against him by one Sindhu Sabale, he has filed such false FIR belatedly. All the applicants are innocent. They have not committed any offence. In fact they are beaten by the informant party severely and all the applicants have sustained grievous injuries. They are undergoing treatment. One Vilas Sabale filed complaints with the revenue authorities against the informant who is Ex­Sarpanch of the village for his corruption matters. Being enraged, he has lodged false FIR. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n2. According to advocate Mr. Mardhekar, at the relevant time, applicants were not present on the spot of alleged incident. They were attending the marriage of their close family member. For that purpose, he invited my attention to the photographs produced on record along­with list at Exh.16. He lastly submitted that applicants are local residents. If they are arrested then their reputation is likely to be maligned. They are ready to obey with all the conditions those may be imposed upon them. He invited my attention to the photographs of applicants and their family members which are produced on record in other bail application. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3. He further submitted that the informant, in another Crime No.59/2019 has sworn in affidavit before the Notary that alleged incident did not take place and she has filed application with the Superintendent of Police, Satara that she lodged the FIR out of misunderstanding and has no grievance against these applicants. Therefore advocate Mr. Mardhekar prayed that by imposing certain conditions, pre­arrest protection may be granted to these applicants. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4. APP Mr. Oak by filing his say at Exh.14 strongly resisted the application. He submitted that, at the relevant time when the informant was proceeding by his Mahindra jeep along­ with one Dharmaji Babar, all the applicants formed an unlawful assembly armed with deadly weapons like wooden logs. They caused damage to the jeep by breaking its front side glass. They abused and threatened the informant. Applicant No.3 dragged him outside the jeep and then all of them assaulted him by means of wooden logs. Not only that, all the applicants throttled the neck of informant and attempted to kill him. Applicants also assaulted the 3/6 Criminal Bail Application No. 164/2019 witness Aakash Kadav by means of wooden log who was accompanying the informant at the relevant time. The quarrel took place on account of obstruction of funeral procession on the dead­ body which was going through the property of applicants. There is dispute on account of the way to cremation ground. Remaining accused are absconding. Involvement of these applicants in the commission of offence is transpired. Their custodial interrogation is required for the purpose of recovery of weapons and overall investigation. Atmosphere in the village is tense due to lodging of cross complaints. In case of grant of pre­arrest protection to these applicants, repetition of such type of offences cannot be ruled out. All the applicants are likely to tamper with the evidence of prosecution. There is danger to the lives of informant and witnesses at the hands of these applicants. By inviting my attention to the photographs in the police papers, he submitted that application may be rejected. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5.

There is danger to the lives of informant and witnesses at the hands of these applicants. By inviting my attention to the photographs in the police papers, he submitted that application may be rejected. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6. After going through the FIR lodged by one Ramdas Kadav, it is seen that he was going to village Sabalewadi by his Mahindra jeep No. MH­11/DL­2591 along­with one Dharmaji Babar. That time all the applicants after obstructing his jeep, formed an unlawful assembly armed with deadly weapons like wooden logs and caused mischief to the jeep by breaking its glass. Vilas and Ramesh Sabale inflicted blows of wooden log on the glass due to which the informant sustained injuries on his eyes and 5/6 Criminal Bail Application No. 164/2019 face. By uttering the words “ आज तत एकटट सटपडलट आहहस, ततलट ज ववत ”ससडत नटहह , one more associate of applicants dragged the informant outside the jeep and tried to throttle his neck. Any how the informant could rescue from their clutches. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n7. On the way, they met Police Official Mulani. He sent the informant to Police Station. While going to police station, all the applicants again obstructed his jeep, abused him and assaulted him by means of wooden log and stones. By hearing his shouts, the police official accompanying him rescued the scuffle. But in the event, the villager Aakash Kadav was also beaten by Ramesh Sabale by means of wooden log and he sustained severe head injury. Informant went to Satara Hospital and was undergoing treatment. Therefore according to him, there was delay in lodging the FIR. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n8. After going through the police papers it is seen that both the parties are on rival terms on account of approach way to the cremation ground. At the relevant time, the dispute arose in between them on account of funeral procession which was going towards cremation ground through the land of applicants. Both the parties have lodged cross complaints against each other. Alleged offences are too serious. The weapons used in the commission of offence are yet to be seized. For the purpose of overall investigation, custodial interrogation of these applicants is certainly warranted. If pre­arrest protection is granted to them then entire investigation would be paralyzed. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n9. Taking into consideration nature and seriousness of accusation and gravity of offences, these applicants do not deserve to get pre­arrest protection. If such pre­arrest protection is granted to them then there is likelihood of repetition of such type of offences at their hands. As stated by the prosecution in its say, situation in the village is tense as persons from both the parties are seriously injured in the incident. Merely on the basis of photographs and at this stage, it cannot be said safely that applicants were elsewhere at the time of incident. As such, application deserves to be rejected. Hence the order follows:­ \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER 1 Application is rejected. (Order is dictated and pronounced in the open Court) \r\n---order-ends---\r\nSatara (R.D.Deshpande) Dt.10/04/2019. Additional Sessions Judge, Satara."
