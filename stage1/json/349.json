    "text": "This is an application for anticipatory bail as per section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Heard advocate Mr. Dhaigude for applicants. He submitted that Crime No. 69/2019 is registered against these applicants with Satara Taluka Police Station for the offences punishable under sections 326 etc. read with section 149 of the Indian Penal Code and under section 3 punishable under section 25 of the Arms Act, 1959. Applicants are apprehending their arrest in this crime. According to him, applicants are innocent and have not committed any offence as alleged in the FIR. Applicants and informant are in blood relations. There is civil dispute in between them on account of partition of the joint family property. Out of that civil dispute, a false and concocted FIR has been lodged by the informant Sou. Sharda Barkade. Applicants are of young age and are local residents. They are ready to obey with all the conditions those may be imposed upon them. Their custodial interrogation is not at all warranted. Section 394 is dropped by the prosecution and it is replaced by section 327 of the Indian Penal Code. Applicant No.2 is FYBA student and in case of his arrest, his educational career would be spoiled. Therefore, he submitted that by imposing certain conditions, applicants may be released on anticipatory bail.",

  "processedText": "ORDER BELOW EXH.01 IN CRI. MISC. APPLN. NO. 165/2019 MHST01­000863­2019 Dhanaji Dadasaheb Barkade etc.3 Vs. State of Maharashtra \r\n---header-ends---\r\nThis is an application for anticipatory bail as per section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Heard advocate Mr. Dhaigude for applicants. He submitted that Crime No. 69/2019 is registered against these applicants with Satara Taluka Police Station for the offences punishable under sections 326 etc. read with section 149 of the Indian Penal Code and under section 3 punishable under section 25 of the Arms Act, 1959. Applicants are apprehending their arrest in this crime. According to him, applicants are innocent and have not committed any offence as alleged in the FIR. Applicants and informant are in blood relations. There is civil dispute in between them on account of partition of the joint family property. Out of that civil dispute, a false and concocted FIR has been lodged by the informant Sou. Sharda Barkade. Applicants are of young age and are local residents. They are ready to obey with all the conditions those may be imposed upon them. Their custodial interrogation is not at all warranted. Section 394 is dropped by the prosecution and it is replaced by section 327 of the Indian Penal Code. Applicant No.2 is FYBA student and in case of his arrest, his educational career would be spoiled. Therefore, he submitted that by imposing certain conditions, applicants may be released on anticipatory bail. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2. APP Mr. Oak by filing say at Exh.9 strongly resisted the application. He replied that at the relevant time, all the applicants along­with their other associates formed an unlawful assembly and in prosecution of common object of that assembly, by pointing the pistol near the right ear of informant, all of them have severely beaten her husband by means of iron rod and an Axe. They have also snatched the golden ornaments from the necks of informant and her husband. They have also beaten mother­in­law of informant namely Parubai and her nephew namely Amol by means of iron rod, iron pipe, kicks, fists etc. Informant, her nephew and her mother­in­law have sustained injuries during the incident. They were admitted at Civil Hospital. Injury sustained by Amol is grievous. Alleged offences are serious. Applicants and informant are residing adjacent to each other. In case they are released on bail then there is likelihood of repetition of such type of offences in future at their hands. Weapons used in the commission of offence are yet to be seized so also the golden ornaments. For that purpose, custodial interrogation of these applicants is necessary. If pre­arrest protection is granted to them then entire investigation would be paralyzed. On all these grounds, he submitted that application may be rejected. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3. After going through the FIR, it is seen that, there is dispute in between the parties on account of joint family property. However, the father­in­law of informant namely Namdeo has already apportioned the amount of Rs.25,00,000/­ received by him by way of sale of joint family property. Some land is still recorded in the name of his wife Parubai. All the applicants along­with their associates formed an unlawful assembly and entered the flour­mill of informant. Applicant No.3 pointed out the pistol near her right ear and by giving threats with life injury, asked her to record the land standing in the name of her mother­in­law in the name of Dadarao. Applicants No.1 and 2 have severely beat her husband, her mother­in­law Parubai and nephew Amol by means of iron rod, iron pipe, kicks and fists. In the event they have voluntarily caused grievous hurt to her nephew Amol and hurt to her to extract the property i.e. golden ornaments. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4. When all the applicants entered the flour­mill of informant armed with deadly weapons like, pistol, iron rod, iron pipe etc., it goes to show that they seem to have committed alleged offences after preparation to cause grievous hurt. Alleged offences are serious. The weapons used in the commission of offence are yet to be seized. Under such circumstances, if pre­arrest protection is granted to applicants then entire investigation would be paralyzed. Informant and all the witnesses are injured in the incident and alleged offence is committed in a broad day light in the afternoon time. Applicants and informant are residing adjacent to each other. Their relations are already strained. Under such circumstances, if pre­arrest protection is granted to applicants then there is likelihood of repetition of such type of offences at their hands. Taking into consideration the nature and seriousness of accusation and gravity of offences, recovery of weapons and strained relations in between the parties, it would not be just and safe to release these applicants on anticipatory bail. Investigation is yet not completed. Hence the order follows :­ \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER Application is rejected. (Order is dictated and pronounced in the open Court) \r\n---order-ends---\r\nSatara (R.D.Deshpande) Dt.25/03/2019. Additional Sessions Judge, Satara."
