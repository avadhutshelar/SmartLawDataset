The mob was proceeding by the private property of the informant. Moreover son of the informant disclosed some corruption matters of applicant No.1. Being aggrieved, all the applicants formed an unlawful assembly. They were armed with deadly weapons. In the presence of police officials, they have assaulted the informant and her family members. In the said incident, applicant No.1 tried to run over the informant\u0027s son Ramesh by his vehicle so also he assaulted the informant on her head. The family members of informant are also injured in this incident. The weapons like wooden logs, iron rods, stones etc. are used in the commission of offence. To seize the weapons, custody of these applicants is necessary by the police. Atmosphere in the village is tense due to cross complaints. In case of release of these applicants on anticipatory bail, there is likelihood of repetition of such type of offences at the hands of applicants. There is also likelihood of tampering with the evidence of prosecution. There is danger to the life of informant and her family members. On all these grounds, he submitted that application may be rejected.",

  "processedText": "ORDER BELOW EXH.01 IN CRI. BAIL APPLN. NO. 141/2019 MHST01­000716­2019 Ramdas Uttam Kadav etc.11 Vs. State of Maharashtra \r\n---header-ends---\r\nThis is an application for anticipatory bail as per section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Heard advocate Mr. Begampure for applicants. He submitted that Crime No.58/2019 is registered against these applicants with Satara Taluka Police Station for the offences punishable under sections 307 etc. read with section 149 of the Indian Penal Code. \r\n---background-ends---\r\nApplicants are apprehending their arrest in this crime. They are innocent and have not committed any offence. In fact informant and her relatives obstructed the funeral procession of one lady namely Suman Pralhad Sabale of the village Sabalewadi on 24/02/2019 on the ground that procession was being taken from their land. In fact the informant and the party have beaten seriously these applicants and their family members and the informant has lodged false FIR against these applicants to implicate them. Applicant No.1 is the Ex­Sarpanch of village Sabalewadi. Applicant No.2 at present working as a Deputy Sarpanch of he village and other applicants are their family members. All of them are respectable persons. If they are arrested then their reputation is likely to be maligned and they would suffer an irreparable loss. They are local residents. They are ready to obey with all the conditions those may be imposed upon them. There is civil dispute pending in between the parties on account of approach way to the cremation ground. For that purpose he invited my attention to various documents placed on record including the FIR lodged by these applicants against informant and her family members. He also invited my attention to the photographs produced on record along­with list at Exh.10 and submitted that informant party was aggressive in the commission of offence as they were armed with deadly weapons like wooden logs. According to him, custodial interrogation of these applicants is not warranted. Therefore he submitted that by imposing certain conditions, applicants may be released on anticipatory bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n2. APP Mr. Oak by filing say at Exh.8 strongly resisted the application. He replied that alleged offences are serious. He submitted that quarrel took place in between the informant, her family members and these applicants on account of obstruction of funeral procession of the dead­body. The mob was proceeding by the private property of the informant. Moreover son of the informant disclosed some corruption matters of applicant No.1. Being aggrieved, all the applicants formed an unlawful assembly. They were armed with deadly weapons. In the presence of police officials, they have assaulted the informant and her family members. In the said incident, applicant No.1 tried to run over the informant\u0027s son Ramesh by his vehicle so also he assaulted the informant on her head. The family members of informant are also injured in this incident. The weapons like wooden logs, iron rods, stones etc. are used in the commission of offence. To seize the weapons, custody of these applicants is necessary by the police. Atmosphere in the village is tense due to cross complaints. In case of release of these applicants on anticipatory bail, there is likelihood of repetition of such type of offences at the hands of applicants. There is also likelihood of tampering with the evidence of prosecution. There is danger to the life of informant and her family members. On all these grounds, he submitted that application may be rejected. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3. From the photographs placed on record, it is seen that incident has taken place in the presence of police officials. In the commission of offences, deadly weapons like wooden logs, iron rods and stones are used. Informant and her family members are seriously injured in the incident. Informant has sustained fracture injury. There are two rival groups and have filed cross complaints against each other. For recovery of weapons, custodial interrogation of these applicants is certainly required by the police. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4. Apart from that situation in the village is tense. Taking into consideration the rivalry and previous quarrels in between the parties on account of approach way to the cremation ground, it would not be just and safe to grant pre­arrest protection to these applicants. It would be difficult to recover the deadly weapons used in the commission of offence. Moreover as stated by the prosecution in its say, there is danger to the lives of informant and her family members at the hands of applicants. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5. Considering the nature and gravity of offences so also the seriousness of accusation, custodial interrogation of these applicants is warranted. As such it would not be just and safe to release these applicants on anticipatory bail. If such pre­arrest protection is granted to him then entire investigation would be paralyzed. Hence the order follows :­ \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER Application is rejected. (Order is dictated and pronounced in the open Court) \r\n---order-ends---\r\nSatara (R.D.Deshpande) Dt.12/03/2019. Additional Sessions Judge, Satara."
