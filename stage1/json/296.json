The applicant, namely, Mukesh Manik Jadhav apprehending his arrest in C.R.No.10 of 2019 for the offences punishable under Sections 353, 341, 225, 504, 506 r/w 34 of the Indian Penal Code registered with Phaltan City Police Station, has filed this application for anticipatory bail. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n02. Perused application and say of learned A.P.P. 03. From the contents of complaint of Ratnasinh Baban Sonwalkar in C.R.No.10 of 2019, it reveals that, the alleged incident had taken place on 13.01.2019, at about 12.50 p.m., near Swami Samarth Mandir, Maltan, Taluka Phaltan. From the contents of complaint, it further reveals that, on 12.01.2019, Sunny Manik Jadhav and Ganesh Mahadeo Telkhade were found manufacturing illicit liquor which is dangerous to cause hurt to person and after noticing police ran away. On 13.01.2019, at about 09.00 a.m., Ratnasinh Sonwalkar received information that, Sunny Manik Jadhav is present in front of his house on a cement platform. He along with other police staff went there. Sunny Manik Jadhav was found sitting on a platform of cement in front of his house. Sunny Manik Jadhav was making endeavour to run away. In such attempt he was fallen on the ground and sustained injuries. On 13.01.2019, at about 12.50 p.m., applicant and Chandani Mukesh Jadhav, wife of applicant, both resident of Maltan, Taluka Phaltan, abused police and applicant was armed with iron pipe rushed towards police and pushed the police. When police were taking Sunny Jadhav on their motorcycle, applicant, Chandani Mukesh Jadhav and one unknown person obstructed the police when they were discharging their duty and made resistance to police. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n04. According to applicant, he has nothing to do with present crime and is falsely implicated. Brother of applicant by name Sunny is arrested by Phaltan City Police Station in prohibition case and, at that time, police assaulted Sunny and Sunny was injured. Another accused of present crime by name Chandani has been released in present offence. Applicant has no any criminal background. Applicant was convicted previously. Applicant is ready to abide any conditions, if so imposed by the Court. Personal interrogation of applicant is not necessary. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n05. According to learned A.P.P., applicant has no care of law and as such, he is not entitled for pre­arrest protection. Applicant and his wife are criminal minded. Applicant is involved in Crime No.179 of 2018 registered at Phaltan City Police Station for the offence punishable under Sections 39 and 45 of the Maharashtra Money Lending Act and under Section 504, 506 r/w 34 of the Indian Penal Code. Investigation is just started. Unknown person is to be arrested. Custody of applicant is essential to trace out unknown accused. Iron pipe is yet to be seized. If anticipatory bail is granted to applicant, he will abscond. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n06. Nothing is placed on record by learned A.P.P. showing that, applicant was previously convicted in any offence. At the most it can be said that, Crime No.179 of 2018 is registered at Phaltan City Police Station against applicant and same is pending. It is the case of prosecution that, applicant was armed with iron pipe, investigation is in progress and iron pipe is not yet seized / recovered. One unknown accused is not yet traced out. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n07. From the allegations of complaint, it reveals that, according to police, applicant was armed with iron pipe. Complaint nowhere indicates that, applicant assaulted any member of police or anyone by way of iron pipe. However, admittedly yet iron pipe is not yet recovered. True that, anticipatory bail is granted to Chandani, however, considering her role and considering the role of present applicant, in my mind, the principle of parity cannot be applied. In my mind, the personal interrogation of applicant by police is necessary and only after interrogation the iron pipe can be recovered. Investigation is in progress. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n08. Considering the nature and seriousness of the offence, keeping in mind that, iron pipe is not yet seized / recovered, I am of the view that, this is not a fit case in which anticipatory bail can be granted. Hence, I proceed to pass the following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nO R D E R Interim anticipatory bail application of applicant, namely, Mukesh Manik Jadhav is hereby rejected. \r\n---order-ends---\r\nSatara. Date : 25.02.2019. (N.D.Khose) Additional Sessions Judge, Satara."
