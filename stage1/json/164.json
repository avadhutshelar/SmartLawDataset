  "processedText": "Bail Appln.No. 208/2019 CNRâ€“MHPU01-000775-2019 \r\n---header-ends---\r\nORDER BELOW EXH. 1 1. This is an application under Sec. 438 of Cr.P.C. for grant of anticipatory bail. On the basis of the report lodged by informant C.R.No. 176/2018 under Sec. 326, 143, 147, 148, 149, 323, 504, 506 of I.P.C. has been registered with Ranjangaon Police Station. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2. It is alleged by the prosecution that on 29.09.2018 at 9.00 p.m. informant Balasaheb Dunde and his friend Santosh Kandge were taking dinner at Hotel Sujay, Karegaon, Tal. Shirur. At that time accused Mangesh Lakade and Prakash Shelar had come in the hotel and occupied the table for dinner adjacent to the informant. At that time informant received dash by accused Prakash Shelar. At that time altercation took place between informant and accused No. 2 which converted in to scuffle and during the said scuffle the informant was hit by stone in his head. Due to the assault informant was seriously injured and became unconscious. The accused also assaulted Santosh Kandge by kicks and fits blows. After assault accused fled away. Thereafter, informant was admitted in ICU Ward. On the basis of the report lodged by informant C.R.No. 176/2018 under Sec. 326, 143, 147, 148, 149, 323, 504, 506 of I.P.C. has been registered with Ranjangaon Police Station. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3. By this application applicants contend that they have not committed any offence. Story of the prosecution is totally false, fabricated, bogus, concocted and afterthought. Name of applicant No. 1 is not mentioned in the F.I.R. They are ready to abide the conditions imposed by the court. The weapons and vehicles used in the crime have been recovered from the co-accused. There is no recovery or discovery at the hands of applicants. They are permanent residents They are ready to abide the terms and conditions imposed by the court. Thus, applicants prayed for grant of anticipatory bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4. In response to the show cause notice prosecution has filed its say vide Exh. 6 thereby interalia denied all adverse allegations and reiterated its case. It is contended that offence is serious. Due to the assault informant sustained grievous injuries. Accused are residents are resident of Dhoksangvi. Since registration of the offence accused are absconding. They will create hurdle and will abscond. They will commit body offence. On these lines prosecution has prayed for rejection of the application. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5. Heard Ld.Counsel for the applicants and Ld.A.P.P. for the State. Perused case diary and all relevant papers produced by the prosecution. After perusal of record it appears that there are grounds for believing that information is well founded against the accused. Perused active role of the accused in this crime. Admittedly, since registration of the offence applicant accused are absconded. It further appears that informant had sustained serious injury on his head. Considering the active role played by the accused and aggressive conduct of the accused, I am of the opinion that detail investigation is necessary. For that purposes custodial interrogation of the applicants is necessary. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6. Certainly, object of arrest in the present case is not to humiliate the applicants. Bail is rule, however, anticipatory bail is not the rule. It is extra ordinary power of the court to be used springly with circumspection. The matter needs thorough investigation and that can be done only by custodial interrogation of the applicants. Thus, I pass the following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nO R D E R 1. Cri.Bail Appln No. 208/2019 is hereby rejected. 2. Inform to the concern police station. \r\n---order-ends---\r\n( S. H. Gwalani ) Dt. : 16.01.2019 Additional Sessions Judge, Pune."
