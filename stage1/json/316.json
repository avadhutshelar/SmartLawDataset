It is alleged that, applicant and his mother mentally and physically harassed the deceased in order to fulfill their illegal demand of Rs.3,00,000/­ and they abetted her to commit suicide. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4) It is contended that, applicant married with deceased in the year 2000 and they have children a son and a daughter. There is no complaint against applicant or his inlaws by deceased for demand of dowry, no incident of attempt to murder of deceased by the applicant is happened and the contents of FIR are false one. In fact, deceased Dhanashri was under depression in spite of healthy environment in the house, applicant left his aged parents and grand­ mother at village Arvi and shifted to Rahimatpur and then shifted at Satara. It is further stated that, applicant is school teacher, his daughter is at present about to face Examination of H.S.C.Board, he has to look after her at the crucial time, hence prayed for grant of bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5) Application is strongly opposed on behalf of opponent State on the ground that, during the investigation it was revealed that, applicant used to bea the deceased on flimsy grounds and also used to demand money, it is alleged that, in the year 2010 informant has given Rs.5 Lakhs to the applicant, however, again he was harassing for fulfillment of his illegal demand of Rs.3 lakhs, therefore, due to unbearable harassment, deceased committed suicide by hanging. Investigation is just started, hence prayed to reject the application. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6) It is submitted on behalf of prosecution that, there is allegation of attempt to commit murder by the applicant, hence bail may not be granted. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n7) It is submitted on behalf of accused that, accused was in police custody for two days and since last four days, he is in magisterial custody. Accused is required to take his daughter for examination at Rahimatpur from Satara, no other person is in the family of accused to do this work. It is submitted that, the accusation is in respect of offence punishable under Sec. 306 of Indian Penal Code and the reasons mentioned in FIR are false one. The incident occurred after 19 years of marriage of deceased with the accused. It is pointed out that the statements of children are recorded by police. It is further pointed out that, the allegation is subsequently made that accused has tried to commit murder of deceased. There is no complaint about the said incident by pointing out the medical papers. It is submitted that, recently, deceased had undergone nasal surgery and the accused had borne the expenses. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n8) Considering the submissions and after going through the papers, I have to mention that in view of nature of offence, no further custodial interrogation of accused is necessary. The reason that, accused is required to take his daughter for examination to center at Rahimatpur during the examination period scheduled in this month is required to be considered. Nothing is to be seized from the accused, there was ample time to make interrogation of accused while he was in police custody. Hence, accused may be released on bail by imposing conditions. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER 1) Cr.Misc. Application No. 124 of 2019 is allowed. 2) Applicant Umesh Dattatraya Takale be released on bail, in respect of C.R.No.108 of 2019 of Satara City Police Station on his furnishing personal bond of Rs.25,000/­ with one solvent surety on following terms \u0026 conditions : a) Applicant shall attend the concern police station on every Sunday in between 11:00 a.m. to 12.00 noon till filing of charge­sheet. b) Applicant shall not directly or indirectly make any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the case so as to dissuade them from disclosing such facts to the court or to any Police Officer. c) Applicant shall make available himself and co­operate for interrogation by Police Officer as and when required and shall co­operate in the investigation of the present C.R. d) Applicant shall not tamper any of the documents connected to the present C.R. under investigation. \r\n---order-ends---\r\n(B.S.Wavre) Place : Satara Addl.
