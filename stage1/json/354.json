  "processedText": "IN THE COURT OF ADDITIONAL SESSIONS JUDGE, BARAMATI. Cri. Bail Appln. No. 06/2019. MHPU14­ 000021­2019. Shri Tarachand Maruti Gawade Versus State of Maharashtra \r\n---header-ends---\r\nORDER BELOW EXHIBIT 1 This is an application for grant of anticipatory bail under Section 438 of Cr.P.C. filed by the applicant apprehending his arrest in Crime No. 01/2019 under Sections 406, 409 of Indian Penal Code, registered with Walchandnagar Police Station. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2] The applicant contended that false case has been filed against him. There is delay of six years in lodging the FIR. The complainant never paid any installment amount to him. From the last six years the complainant has not followed the loan case matter. The applicant is reputed person and is a Secretary of the society. His family is totally dependent on him. He is permanent resident of village Bharnewadi and he will not abscond. His custodial interrogation is not necessary. Hence, on suitable terms and conditions, bail may be granted to him. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3] Application is opposed by I.O. by filing his say through ld. A.P.P. and has submitted that the offence is of serious nature. Police custody of the accused is required. If accused is released on bail, then police will be debarred from recovering the amount. Also, if accused is released on bail, he will tamper the prosecution evidence and so, they have prayed for rejection of the application. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4] Heard both the sides at length. They have argued as per the contentions raised by them. Also, the complainant filed affidavit and resisted the bail application. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5] I have gone through the FIR and the material available on record. It is the story of complainant that towards repayment of the loan he has paid in cash Rs. 80,000/­ to the accused in July­2012. Thereafter, on 05.6.2018 he received notice of recovery of amount and then came to know that the said installment amount is not deposited by the accused towards the outstanding loan. In this case, the incidents of July­2012 and the FIR is lodged on 03.01.2019. More than six years had been lapsed and thereafter, the FIR has been lodged by the complainant. It appears to the Court that during past 6­7 years no such illegality and irregularity has been reported against the present applicant. He is a Secretary of the society and is permanent resident of village Bharnewadi. Apparently, the amount so given is a oral transaction and there is no documentary evidence to that effect. Looking to the fact that there is inordinate delay in reporting the matter, though the complainant say that recently he came to know about the same. But, it does not appears to be just to the conscious of the Court. Looking to the typical facts and circumstances of the case, anticipatory bail to the accused can be granted. Hence, the following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER (1) Application is allowed. (2) In the event of arrest of the applicant Tarachand Maruti Gawade in CR No. 01/2019 under Sections 406, 409 of Indian Penal Code, registered with Walchandnagar Police Station, be released on bail on furnishing P.B. of Rs. 25,000/­ with surety of one or two in the likewise amount, to the satisfaction of the concerned investigation officer. (3) The applicant shall report to the concerned police station for a period of seven days from 16.01.2019 to 22.01.2019 in between 3.00 pm to 6.00 pm and help the police in investigation. Also, he shall attend the police station as and when his presence is required by police. (4) The applicant shall furnish his permanent as well as temporary address, if any, and his contact details to the concerned I.O. (5) The applicant shall not tamper the prosecution evidence. (6) He shall not commit similar type of offence. (7) He shall not leave India without prior permission of the Court. (8) Bail in lower court. (9) Inform the concerned police station. \r\n---order-ends---\r\nBaramati. [ R.R.Rathi ] Dated : 14.01.2019.. Additional Sessions Judge, Baramati.
