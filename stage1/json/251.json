BAIL APPLN. NO. 54/2019 This is an application for ad­interim anticipatory bail as per section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Heard advocate Mr. D. S. Ghadage, for applicants. He submitted that Crime No.20/2019 is registered against these applicants with Khandala Police Station for the offence punishable under section 420 read with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code. Applicants are having strong apprehension of their arrest in this crime. But according to him, both the applicants are innocent and they have not committed any offence. He fairly submitted that these applicants have received an amount of Rs.50,00,000/­ from the informant Ramdas Baban Jadhav as stated in the FIR. Amount was obtained by them in the name of their firm and that too by way of cheque. As such there was no intention on their part, right from inception to deceive the informant. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2. By inviting my attention to the documents placed on record along­with list at Exh.3, he submitted that both the applicants are duped by one Sunil Dahale for crores of rupees. They were constrained to hand over him huge cash amount as well as gold ornaments. In that crime, investigation is in progress and accused therein namely Sunil Dahale is behind the bars. He also invited my attention to the letter in respect of आतमदहन of one Nandini Kondhalkar, an office bearer of one political party dated 26/01/2019. According to him, when applicants have filed their grievance against the Investigating Officer, API Hanmant Gaikwad of Khandala Police Station with the superior police officers, he by calling the informant in the police station on 25/01/2019, has got registered the said FIR. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3. He further submitted that the dispute in between the parties is of civil nature. Moreover even if the cheque issued to the informant is dishonoured, he is having remedy of prosecution under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, as well as he can file a civil suit. But by dressing the civil dispute into criminal garments, police machinery is harassing these applicants by joining hands with the informant and other agriculturists. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4. By relying upon the bank statement, he submitted that even after dishonourment of the cheque issued to informant, some amount is paid by these applicants to him. It goes to show that their intention was and is never to cheat the informant and other farmers. They are not denying their liability. But only because that they are duped by one Sunil Dahale in their business, they could not repay the due amount. According to him, this is the fit case in which ad­interim pre­arrest protection can be granted to these applicants. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5. He relied upon following cases :­ i. M/s. Indian Oil Corporation Vs. M/s. NEPC India Ltd. and others, reported in 2006 AIR SCW 3830, in which it is held by Hon\u0027ble Apex Court that, “tendency to convert purely civil disputes into criminal cases is deprecated.” ii. Paramjeet Batra Vs. State of Uttarakhand and others, reported in (2013) 11 Supreme Court Cases 673, in which it is held by Hon\u0027ble Apex Court that, “when the dispute is of civil nature then the power under section 482 to be used sparingly and only for the purpose of preventing abuse of the process of the Court otherwise to secure the ends of justice.” iii. Thermax Ltd. and others Vs. K. M. Johny reported in 2011 ALL M R (Cri) 3603, in which it is held by Hon\u0027ble Apex Court that, “when the entire dispute pertains to contractual obligations between the parties and there was merely a breach of contract then the same cannot give rise to criminal prosecution for cheating unless fraudulent or dishonest intention is shown right from the beginning of the transaction.” iv. Mr. Jitendra Nathmal Joshi @ Sharma Vs. The State of Maharashtra, reported in 2011 ALL M R (Cri)2597, in which it is held by Hon\u0027ble Bombay High Court that, “investigation machinery cannot be allowed to be used for the recovery of money for which recovery lies in filing civil suit for appropriate relief.” v. M/s. Chenaji Narsingji and another Vs. S. S. Ranjhen and others, reported in 1989(1) Bom. C. R. 427, in which it is held by Hon\u0027ble Bombay High Court that, “when all the material relating to offence was in possession of the Department then such material can be carried without there being any necessity for custody of accused, when accused were co­operating with the investigation officers and were not absconding then it would be proper to grant bail to them under section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6. I have carefully gone through the FIR lodged by one Ramdas Baban Jadhav. It is seen that he received the compensation amount from the State Government towards acquisition of his land of the village Kesurdi which came to be acquired for the purpose of MIDC. Both the applicants induced him to invest an amount of Rs.50,00,000/­ with them by giving promise to him that they will pay the double amount to him within just one and half years. They also told him that they are dealing in the business of manufacturing golden biscuits and they used to export those biscuits and getting so much profit out of that business. By giving such allurement, they assured the informant that his amount would be repaid by them within one and half year and that too double the amount. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n7. Coming in the words of applicants, informant Ramdas Jadhav has invested an amount of Rs.50,00,000/­ with both the applicants by giving the cheque in the name of their firm namely Vaibhav Gold and Jewelers. That amount is paid by informant to 5/10 Criminal Bail Application No. 54/2019 them on 16/03/2017. The period of one and half year was completed in the month of September 2018. Upon asked about due amount by informant to both the applicants, they gave evasive answers and avoided to pay amount. For the time and again they gave assurance to him that they would transfer that amount in his account. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n8. On 25/10/2018, applicant No.1 issued cheque of Rs.10 lacs in his favour drawn on HDFC Bank, Shirwal Branch. But when the informant presented that cheque in his account, it came to be dishonoured for want of sufficient funds. Thereafter also he met both the applicants. But they gave excuses to him and did not pay the amount. Therefore he has lodged the FIR on 25/01/2019. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n9. It is also important to note that apart from this informant Ramdas Jadhav, six more investors have also invested amounts with these applicants under the same scheme. These transactions have taken place since 10th September 2015 upto January 2016. In spite of completion of the duration of one and half year, both of them have avoided to pay the due amount to the informant and other farmers. Total amount of cheating is Rs.1,25,50,000/­. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n10. Allegations in the FIR against both these applicants are too serious. It may be the fact that applicant No.2 is duped by one Sunil Dahale for one crore rupees, but that cannot be the ground for both these applicants to grant them ad­interim pre­arrest protection. From the entire averments in the FIR, it is seen that right from the inception, they gave allurement to the informant and other agriculturists by inducing them to invest huge amount with them and gave assurance to pay the double amount within the span of just one and half years. Huge amount of Rs.1,29,50,000/­ is to be recovered. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n11. API Gaikwad of Khandala Police Station has issued a Press Note on 25/01/2019 that if some more persons are aggrieved or have invested amount with these applicants then they may contact Khandala Police Station immediately. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n12. In my humble opinion, the transaction as put forth by the applicants with one Sunil Dahale has no relevance with the transaction in question. Because when they have issued a cheque of Rs. Ten lacs to this informant towards his due amount, it also came to be dishonoured. From these overall facts and circumstances, custodial interrogation of these applicants is certainly required by the police. Taking into consideration the huge amount involved in the cheating to the tune of Rs.1,29,50,000/­, if ad­interim pre­arrest protection is granted to these applicants then entire investigation would be paralyzed. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n13. Considering the nature and seriousness of accusation and gravity of offence, investigation in its proper perspective is required to be carried out. For that purpose, presence of these applicants is certainly required by the police. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n14. I have carefully gone through facts of all the cited cases on which advocate Mr. Ghadage placed his reliance. Cases of M/s. Indian Oil Corporation Vs. M/s. NEPC India Ltd. And others, Paramjeet Batra Vs. State of Uttarakhand and others, Thermax Ltd. And others Vs. K. M. Johny and Mr. Jitendra Nathmal Joshi @ Sharma Vs. The State of Maharashtra were for quashing of the criminal proceeding against applicants therein. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n15. In the first cited case M/s. Indian Oil Corporation Vs. M/s. NEPC India Ltd. and others, as held by Hon\u0027ble Apex Court the dispute was of civil nature and pertaining to Aircrafts hypothecated to creditor with right to take possession and default in payment of due amount regarding supply of fuel. In that context, it was Hon\u0027ble Apex Court held that the very requirement of section 405 i.e. the person caused criminal breach of trust must have been entrusted with the property was absent. But such is not the situation in the case at hands. Therefore, with due respect the law laid down therein by Hon\u0027ble Apex is not coming to the help of these applicants. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n16. In the second cited case Paramjeet Batra Vs. State of Uttarakhand and others, the dispute was in respect of letting of two shops. There was written agreement. There was civil dispute filed claiming rent possession. In that context it was held by Hon\u0027ble Apex Court that the dispute was of civil nature. But such is not the situation in the case at hands. Therefore, with due respect the law laid down therein by Hon\u0027ble Apex is not coming to the help of these applicants. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n17. In the third cited case Thermax Ltd. and others Vs. K. M. Johny, there was mere breach of contract. There was no specific allegation in the FIR in respect of payments. Without disclosing these material facts and suppressing the fact that complainant had previously filed three different complaints, complainant filed another complaint before the Magistrate. There was inordinate delay and latches. Taking note of the closure of earlier three complaints, the subsequent complaint filed by him was quashed. But facts of this cited case also are altogether different with the case at hands. Therefore, with due respect the law laid down therein is also not coming to the help of these applicants. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n18. In the 4th cited case Mr. Jitendra Nathmal Joshi @ Sharma Vs. The State of Maharashtra, the FIR did not constitute or disclose commission of any cognizable offence. In that situation, it was held that police were certainly not entitled to investigate into the matter and investigation machinery cannot be allowed to be used for the recovery of money for which the remedy lies in filing a civil suit. But such is not the position in the case at hands. Therefore, with due respect the law laid down therein by Hon\u0027ble Bombay High Court is not coming to the help of these applicants. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n19. Last cited case M/s. Chenaji Narsingji and another Vs. S. S. Ranjhen and others, was in respect of an offences punishable under sections 471 and 465 of the Indian Penal Code and also under the Gold Control Act. All the material which was required to carry out investigation relating to offence was in possession of the Department. Such material can be carried without there being any necessity of accused when accused were co­operating with the investigation officers and were not absconding. In that context it was held proper to grant bail to them under section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n20. But so far as case at hands is concerned, both these applicants duped the informant and various agriculturists in Khandala Taluka for an amount of Rs.1,29,50,000/­. That huge amount is to be recovered. As such their custodial interrogation is necessary by the police. Since facts of this cited case also not being identical with the case hands, wih due respect the law laid down therein by Hon\u0027ble Bombay High Court is not coming to the help of these applicants. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n21. As discussed earlier, considering the facts and circumstances in totality as narrated in the FIR, custodial interrogation of these applicants is certainly required by the police. If ad­interim pre­arrest protection is granted to them then entire investigation would be paralyzed. As such they do not deserve for ad­interim pre­arrest protection. Application deserves to be rejected. Hence the order follows:­ \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER Application is rejected. (Order is dictated and pronounced in the open Court) \r\n---order-ends---\r\nSatara (R.D.Deshpande) Dt.28/01/2019. Additional Sessions Judge, Satara."
