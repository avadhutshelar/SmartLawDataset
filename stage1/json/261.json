  "processedText": "ORDER BELOW EXH.01 IN CRI. BAIL APPLN. NO.66/2019 Sanjay Tatyaba Gaikwad Vs. State of Maharashtra \r\n---header-ends---\r\nThis is an application for anticipatory bail as per section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Heard advocate Mr. Pharande for applicant. He submitted that Crime No.27/2019 is registered against this applicant with Koregaon Police Station for the offence punishable under section 420 read with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code at the instance of one Mrs. Varsha Sandip Gholap. But applicant is innocent. He has purchased the land Block No.573/A situate at the village Vathar Kiroli from the power of attorney holder of the informant namely Jagadish Kajale. Power of attorney executed by informant in favour of jagadish Kajale is duly registered before the Sub­ Registrar, Koregaon so also the sale­deed dated 20/10/2018. Applicant is not at all having any role in the commission of alleged offence. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2. He further submitted that applicant is serving as a teacher at Pune. As such, he is having reputation in the society. If he is arrested on false accusation then he has to loose his job and his reputation is likely to be maligned. Therefore he prayed that ad­interim pre­arrest protection granted to this applicant by this Court by an order dated 31/01/2019 may be confirmed. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3. APP Mr. Muke by filing his say at Exh.6 strongly resisted the application. According to him, this applicant by joining hands with Jagadish Kajale and one more person have got executed false power of attorney from the informant. On the basis of such power of attorney, Jagadish Kajale has executed sale­deed of 20 Gunthas of land out of Block No.573­A of the village Vathar Kiroli in favour of applicant. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4. He further replied that unless applicant is arrested, his role cannot be transpired in this transaction. His custody is required by the police. Informant has not at all received the consideration amount of Rs.4,00,000/­ as mentioned in the sale­ deed. Witnesses on both these documents are one and the same and thereby it is seen that applicant along­with other accused have induced the informant to execute power of attorney and sale­deed, without making her aware about these two particular transactions. Unless this applicant is taken in custody, no progress can be made in the investigation and therefore he prayed that application may be rejected. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5. In reply, advocate Mr. Pharande submitted that the power of attorney as well as sale­deed are the registered documents. As such applicant was not having any intention to cheat the informant. He has paid the consideration of Rs. Four lacs to her power of attorney holder Jagadish Kajale. He is innocent. He is ready to co­operate with investigation machinery. Alleged offence is based on documents and which are already handed over by him to the police. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6. Copy of registered power of attorney dated 19/10/2018 is produced on record by applicant along­with list at Exh.3. what is important to note is that applicant has put her sign in English on that power of attorney and it also bears her photograph which was snapped before the Sub­Registrar, Koregaon. When she put her sign on said document in English, it cannot be said that she is illiterate. When she has executed registered power of attorney in favour of Jagadish Kajale on 19/10/2018 thereby authorizing him to execute sale­deed of the said land then no fault can be found with this applicant. Because he has purchased said land also by registered sale­deed from the power of attorney holder of informant Varsha Gholap. The dispute is mainly in between informant and Jagadish Kajale for which this applicant cannot be blamed at all. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n7. When both the documents are duly registered before the Sub­Registrar, Koregaon, I find no substance in the contention of prosecution that applicant has committed any role in the commission of alleged offence. Had the power of attorney not been registered before the Sub­Registrar, the matter would have been otherwise. Moreover allegations of cheating in the FIR are mainly against Jagadish Kajale. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n8. So far as case of this applicant is concerned, it is not at par with Jagadish Kajale. Applicant is a teacher and as such he is having reputation in the society. If he is arrested then he would have to loose his job. Alleged offences are based on documents which are already handed over by applicant to the police. Directions are already given to him to attend Koregaon Police Station on every 2nd and 4th Sunday in between 11.00 a.m. to 12.00 noon until further orders and he shall not tamper with the evidence of prosecution. As such ad­interim pre­arrest protection granted to this applicant deserves to be confirmed on the same conditions. There is no need for custodial interrogation of this applicant. Hence the order follows :­ \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER 1 Application is allowed. 2 In the event of his arrest in Crime No. 27/2019 registered with Koregaon Police Station for the offence punishable under section 420 read with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, applicant Sanjay Tatyaba Gaikwad, be released on anticipatory bail, upon his executing P. R. Bond of Rs.15,000/­ (fifteen thousands) with one surety in the like amount, on following conditions : i. that he shall attend Koregaon Police Station on every 2nd and 4th Sunday in between 11.00 a.m. to 12.00 noon without fail until further orders. 5/5 Criminal Bail Application No. 66/2019 ii. that he shall not directly or indirectly, make any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the accusation against him so as to dissuade them from disclosing such facts to the Court or to any police officer. iii. that he shall not threaten informant or witnesses of the prosecution in any way. 3 Failure to obey any of the conditions above, would be liable to cancellation of anticipatory bail granted to applicant. 4 Inform Koregaon Police Station accordingly. (Order is dictated and pronounced in the open Court) \r\n---order-ends---\r\nSatara (R.D.Deshpande) Dt.15/02/2019. Additional Sessions Judge, Satara."
