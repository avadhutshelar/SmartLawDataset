  "processedText": "ORDER BELOW EXH.01 IN CRI. BAIL APPLN. NO. 129/2019 MHST01­000664­2019 Malkhan Narsing Rathod etc.2 Vs. State of Maharashtra \r\n---header-ends---\r\nThis is an application for regular bail as per section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Heard advocate Mr. Narkar for applicantS. He submitted that in Crime No.11/2019 registered with Rahimatpur Police Station for the offences punishable under sections 420, 406 read with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, applicants are behind the bars since 08/02/2019. \r\n---background-ends---\r\nThey had undergone custodial interrogation in police custody. Nothing could be seized at their hands. Both of them are old aged. They are ready to furnish solvent surety to the satisfaction of this Court and are also ready to obey with all the conditions those may be imposed upon them. The FIR which is lodged against them is false and concocted and they did not commit any offence. Therefore he submitted that by imposing certain conditions, they may be released on bail. He invited my attention to the copies of notices issued by applicants to the informant. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n2. APP Mr. Oak by filing say at Exh.5 strongly resisted the application. He replied that both the applicants are dealing in the business of supplying labours for cutting sugarcane in the sugarcane cutting season. For this season, informant and five others entered into an agreement with both the applicants and paid them an amount of Rs. Five lacs each for supply of labours along­with instruments. But in spite of payment of an amount of Rs. 30 lacs, both the applicants did not keep the terms of agreement and they did not supply the labours along­with instruments. Informant and others went to their native in Chalisgaon Taluka in Jalgaon District. But they came to know that they were not even found in their village and thereby they cheated the informant and others for the huge amount of Rs.30 lacs. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3. According to him, amount is paid to both the applicants by RTGS. Right from the inception, there was intention of applicants to cheat the informant and others. Investigation is in progress. Huge amount involved in cheating is yet to be seized. If applicants are released on bail then investigation would be paralyzed. He also pointed out to the notice of this Court that around 250 people from the village obstructed the police staff and vehicles and committed the offence of rioting by using force and violence. Taking into consideration the conduct and behaviour of applicants, it would not be just and safe to release them on bail. Some more accused are to be apprehended and therefore he submitted that application may be rejected. He also submitted that these applicants have committed similar type of offences in Khandala, Navapur, Jalgaon, Pune, Bhokardan, Chalisgaon etc. Applicants are habitual criminals. On all these grounds, he submitted that application may be rejected. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4. After going through the FIR lodged by informant, it is seen that he and witnesses who are farmers and owners of vehicles for transporting the sugarcane, entered into an agreement with these applicants and three others. Informant and others have each paid an amount of Rs. Five lacs to applicants and others total worth Rs.30 lacs. Both the applicants and their associates assured the informant and other farmers that they would supply the labours for the purpose of cutting of sugarcane crop. But in spite of accepting huge amount of Rs.30 lacs, they did not provide the labours and tried to abscond from the village. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5. Say filed by the prosecution further discloses that applicants are habitual criminals. Similar type of offences are registered against them at Khandala, Navapur, Jalgaon, Pune, Bhokardan, Chalisgaon etc. Police Stations. It appears at this stage that right from the inception of the contract, there was an element of cheating on the part of these applicants. Investigation is at progressive stage. Nothing could be seized from these applicants during their custodial interrogation. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6. Considering the conduct and behaviour of applicants that the mob of about 200 to 250 persons obstructed police vehicle by committing an offence of rioting, used criminal force and violence to the police force. Under such circumstances, it would not be just and safe to release these applicants on bail when investigation is at progressive stage and it is incomplete. Some more persons are yet to be apprehended. Taking into consideration the nature and seriousness of offences, it would not be just and safe to release these applicants on bail though alleged offences are triable by the JMFC. Hence the order follows :­ \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER Application is rejected. (Order is dictated and pronounced in the open Court) \r\n---order-ends---\r\nSatara (R.D.Deshpande) Dt.07/03/2019. Additional Sessions Judge, Satara."
