(CNR â€“ MHPU01 - 000915 -2019) \r\n---header-ends---\r\nOrder below Exh.1 (Passed on this 24th day of January, 2019) This is an application under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, for grant of bail to the applicant/accused for the offences punishable under Sections 306, 323, 504 and 506 of the Indian Penal Code in Crime No.414/2018, registered with MIDC Bhosari Police Station, Pune. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2] The prosecution case, in short, is that the complainant Pravin Dnyandeo Gavali lodged report to the police station MIDC Bhosari inter alia contending that the accused persons in furtherance of their common intention have illtreated his sister deceased Rekha by suspecting on her character and abused her and beat her and abetted her to commit suicide. On these allegations, report is lodged and offence punishable under sections 306, 323, 504 and 506 read with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code came to be registered against the accused and others vide crime No. 414/18. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3] The contention of the applicant/accused is that he is innocent and he has not committed any offence as 2 alleged. He is a respectable man of the society. The applicant is not a previous convict, neither he has any criminal antecedents. He is permanent resident of Pune. The investigation is over and charge sheet has been filed. He is ready to abide by the terms and conditions that may be imposed by this Court. Lastly, he prayed to release him on bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4] The learned A.P.P. has opposed the application by filing say at Exh.5 on the ground that the accused and complainant are relatives. If the accused is released on bail, he will pressurize the complainant and witnesses. The accused and witnesses are from the same locality. The sons of applicant are residing in the house of applicant, hence he will pressurize them. Lastly, he prayed to reject the application. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5] Heard learned A.P.P. for the State. Heard learned Advocate for accused. Gone through the record. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6] In view of these facts, following points arise for determination and findings thereon are recorded against each of them, for the reasons stated below : Points Findings 1. Whether the accused is No. 3 Cri. B.A. No.277/19. entitled for bail ? 2. What order ? As per final order. REASONS Point No.1 :- \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n7] On perusal of statements of witnesses, it clearly reveals that the accused has abetted commission of suicide by deceased. There are two child witnesses to the incident. Statement of complainant clearly reveals the role played by the accused in the offence in question. Though charge sheet is filed, considering the nature of offence and considering that sons of accused are residing in the same house, where accused was residing and sons of accused are eye witnesses to the incident and if he is released on bail, he will pressurize them and prosecution witnesses. Prima facie involvement of the accused appears in the offence in question. The apprehension of the prosecution is well founded from the act of the accused person. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n8] Considering these facts and considering the nature and gravity of offence and the role played by the accused in the offence in question, though charge sheet is filed, I am of the view that this is not a fit case to exhaust judicial discretion of bail. Therefore, it is not just 4 and desirable to release the applicant/accused on bail. Hence, following order is passed. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER Application (Exh.1) stands rejected. \r\n---order-ends---\r\n(Mrs. M.M.
