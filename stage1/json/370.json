NO. 22/2019 ORDER BELOW EXH. 1 IN CRIMINAL BAIL APPLICATION NO. 22 OF 2019 MHPU14-000118-2019 \r\n---header-ends---\r\n1] Present application is filed by the accused Seena (accused no. 2), with request to grant her bail, u/s. 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure-1973 against whom Crime No. 1000 of 2018 is registered in the Baramati city police station ( District â€“ Pune ), for having committed offence punishable U/ss. 363, 376 r/w 34 of I.P.C and under sections 4, 8 and 12 of POCSO Act. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2] It is prosecution case, the incident took place on 12/12/2018. It is prosecution case, on the day of incident at evening time accused no.1 took away victim girl from Baramati S.T. stand and thereafter kept her at different places, he also kept physical relation with her. It is prosecution case, applicant-accused helped accused no.1 for taking away victim girl from Baramati S.T stand and facilitate commission of offence. It is prosecution case, that on getting information of the offence, case is registered against the accused and one another. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3] Learned advocate Mr. Jagtap appearing for the applicant- accused submitted arguments in the line of application filed. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4] Per contra, learned APP Mr. Joshi submitted arguments in the line of say (exh.5) submitted by the prosecution. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5] I have given anxious thought to the arguments advanced on behalf of the accused and prosecution. I have also perused police papers produced for examination. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6] Nature of the offence alleged to have committed by the accused is serious. Investigation is in progress. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n7] Same time, it cannot be overlooked material collected by the prosecution shows, role played by the applicant-accused is limited. Moreover, objection taken to release applicant-accused on bail, is only that she would put pressure upon the witnesses. In my view, care of it can be taken putting stringent conditions and for that reason it is not desirable to keep the applicant-accused behind the bar for indefinite period. 8] In the result, following order is passed :- \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER i] Bail application is allowed. ii] Accused Seena Mahesh Bhosale, be released on bail on execution of P.B. of Rs. 25,000/-with one or two sureties in the like amount. iii] Accused not to misuse the liberty given. vi] Accused to attend concerned police station as per requirement of I.O. till filing of the charge sheet. v] Accused to submit legally acceptable identity and address proof. vi] In case of agricultural property 7x12 extract and in case of non-agricultural property, CTS extract is to be produced.
