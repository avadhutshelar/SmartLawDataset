  "processedText": "ORDER BELOW EXH. 1 IN CRI. BAIL APPLICATION No. 3/2019 (Avinash Sayaji Kadam Vs. State of Maharashtra) CNR : MHST01­000025­2019 \r\n---header-ends---\r\n1) Present application is filed by the applicant seeking his release from arrest under C.R. no. 149/2018, registered at Rahimatpur police station on 30/08/2018, at the instance of Akash Ramchandra Mulik, for alleged commission of offences punishable under sections 306, 504 and 506 r/w. 34 of Indian Penal Code, 1860. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2) Applicant\u0027s advocate argued that, applicant accused is falsely arrested in the FIR without having any concern with the victim\u0027s death. It is contended that, FIR is filed after unexplained delay of 5 days. Other accused Pradeep, named in FIR is already arrested and released on bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3) Present accused has got no concern with the incident at all, as the incident of victim committing suicide is dated 25/08/2018 and this applicant has joined his services in the Border Security Force (BSF) at Haryana on 02/08/2018. Since then applicant has been at Haryana only. Therefore, applicant was never in contact with the victim; therefore, this accused could never black­mail, harass or abet her suicide. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4) It is also contended that, informant has revealed in the FIR of having met Pooja at 10:00 am on the fateful day. As against this the accidental death informant Bhimrao Mulik states of informant Akash having told him of Pooja missing from home since 7:30 a.m. It is accordingly contended that, material transpiring in the charge­sheet itself reveals the contradictory narrations of Akash Mulik. Akash Mulik\u0027s FIR contradicts Bhimrao Mulik\u0027s statement. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5) It is further contended that, the well near which Pooja\u0027s dead body was found is stated to be 30 ft. deep and water was in it upto 25 fts. It is contended that, if at all, that even if Pooja might have committed suicide by jumping in the well even at 10:00 a.m. or 7:00 a.m., Parekh\u0027s Medical Jurisprudence mentions of, a dead body to float up after 18 to 24 hours in summer season or it may even take 24 to 26 hours in winter season. It is contended by the applicant/accused\u0027s advocate that, dead body was found near the well at about 11:15 a.m., it is not possible that, the dead body had floated up. Thus, Pooja\u0027s death can never be by drowning, it would rather be a murder, honour killing may be by Pooja\u0027s family members. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6) It is further contended that, prosecution case of suicidal death is also not supported by post­mortem report as it mentions of Pooja\u0027s lungs being filled with water; then it ought to have been submerged in water. It could not float up so early. Even the doctor conducting post­mortem had reserved his opinion about the probable cause of death and upon receipt of C.A. report had opined the probable cause of death as \u0027probably due to drowning\u0027. It is contended that, even said doctor has not certain about the cause of Pooja\u0027s death. It is accordingly contended that, Pooja\u0027s death is suspicious and it cannot be by drowning. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n7) It is further contended that, investigation is completed and charge­sheet is filed, however not a single conversation between Pooja and this accused is unveiled in the investigation. Therefore, it cannot be said that, accused has abated Pooja\u0027s suicide. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n8) It is further contended that, the messages forming part of investigation records are about conversations and chats between Pooja and her paramour Mahesh. Those also in no circumstances can be considered as any abatement by this accused. It is contended that, infact Pooja\u0027s conversation with Mahesh started on 24/08/2018 since 8:00 p.m. and continued upto 2:30 a.m. of 25/08/2018. Said chatting conversation was through the informant\u0027s mobile, therefore creation of false chat records accordingly is also contended. It is contended that, the chatting conversation between informant and Mahesh is forged to show it as that between Pooja and Mahesh. Accused advocate further contended that even if said chatting conversation is genuine, the said conversation can also triggered Poja\u0027s suicide, hence Mahesh would have also abated Pooja\u0027s suicide. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n9) It is contended that, the entire prosecution case relies on the chatting conversation shown to be as that between Pooja and Mahesh. Accused is in arrest since 30/11/2018 and in MCR since 05/12/2018. Present bail application is preferred on the grounds of change in circumstances in the nature of investigation is completed, charge­sheet is filed. Accused serves in the Armed Forces, therefore easily traceable and no reason for him to abscond away. Accordingly, bail is contended. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n10) Bail application is resisted by the APP by filing say at Exh. 5, on the grounds that, earlier bail application preferred by the accused one seeking pre­arrest bail and other regular bail was rejected on merits. Hence, present bail is not maintainable. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n11) It is contended that, allegations against the accused are serious. Applicant/accused was in love­relation with Pooja. Applicant is already married to another girl, inspite of it, blackmailed and threatened Pooja to have physical relations with him. Another accused Parsha knowing about it, also blackmailed Pooja seeking similar favours. This accused and Parsha both blackmailed Pooja and sought physical favours from her. Being unable to bear it, Pooja committed suicide on 25/08/2018. The factum of harassments are transpired in the investigation through the chatting conversations between Pooja and Mahesh Jagdale. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n12) It is contended that, accused is serving in Armed Forces, posted at Gurgaon­Haryana, in case of release on bail, his absconding, pressurizing the witnesses, tampering of evidences, etc. cannot be ruled out. APP further contended that mere filing of charge­sheet cannot entitle accused to be released on bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n13) Upon hearing the APP and the applicant\u0027s advocate and perused the record, it appears that, victim Pooja was in relation with this accused. Accused Avinash got married to another girl. Allegations in the FIR are that, Avinash after his marriage, again threatened and pestered Pooja seeking physical favours from her. Avinash\u0027s cousin Parsha also threatened Pooja demanding similar favours from her. It transpires in the investigation of accused having sent some messages to Mahesh. Conversations between Mahesh and Pooja, revealing allegations against the accused, are forming part of investigation records. Allegations of abatement are denied on the grounds of accused being at his posting station in Haryana, at the relevant time. Pooja\u0027s suicidal death is also disposed by this accused, rather allegations of honour killing is raised in defence. It transpires that, investigation in the matter is completed, other accused is already released on bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n14) The fact that charge­sheet is filed against this accused, investigation stands completed, however, it is uncertain as to the time to be consumed for trial to commence and conclude, hence keeping him arrested till conclusion of trial may amount to pre­trial punishment. Further, the fact that accused serves in the Armed Forces, possibility of his absconding is too remote. At the same time, considering the proximity of accused with the witnesses, APP\u0027s apprehensions cannot be ruled out, but the same can be taken care of subject to the accused to certain conditions. Hence, the following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nO R D E R 1) Criminal Bail Application no. 03/2019, is allowed. 2) Accused Avinash Sayaji Kadam, be released on bail, from his arrest under C.R. no. 149/2018, registered at Rahimatpur police station on his furnishing personal bond of Rs. 25,000/­ (Rs. Twenty Five Thousand) with one or more surety/ies, to make up the bond amount, on following terms and conditions; a) Accused shall not tamper with any evidence. b) Accused shall not directly or indirectly make any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the case so as to dissuade him from disclosing such facts to the court or to any Police Officer. c) Accused shall make available himself and co­operate for interrogation by Police Officer as and when required. d) Any default of above conditions shall render the bail to be cancelled automatically. e) Compliance before lower Court. \r\n---order-ends---\r\n(Y.
