  "processedText": "ORDER BELOW EXH.01 IN CRI. MISC. APPLN. NO.142/2019 Raju Sandip Pardeshi etc.3 Vs. State of Maharashtra CNR­MHST01­000717­2019 \r\n---header-ends---\r\nThis is an application for anticipatory bail as per section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Heard advocate Mr. Dhaigude for applicants. He submitted that Crime No. 13/2019 is registered against these applicants with Mahabaleshwar Police Station for the offences punishable under sections 454, 457, 380 etc. read with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code. \r\n---background-ends---\r\nThey are having strong apprehension of their arrest in this crime. According to him, the informant is occupying the premises of these applicants on rent. But since last so many years, he has not paid rent nor he is vacating the premises. In order to harass these applicants and in order that he should not be evicted from the tenanted premises, he has lodged the false FIR against applicants merely on suspicion. Applicants are respectable persons running their business at Mahabaleshwar. If they are arrested then their reputation would be maligned and they would suffer an irreparable loss. They are ready to obey with all the conditions those may be imposed upon them. Therefore he prayed that ad­ interim pre­arrest protection granted to these applicants may be confirmed on same conditions. He invited my attention to the photographs produced on record along­with list at Exh.7 in which it is seen that informant and his mother are carrying on their business in the tenanted premises. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n2. APP Mr. Oak by filing his say at Exh.8 resisted the application. He replied that though the incident took place in between the night of 14/02/2019 and 15/02/2019, FIR came to be lodged on 18/02/2019 only when the informant heard from applicant No.2 that his stolen goods would be returned after he pays the rent. Except applicants, nobody else was having reason to commit this offence. Relations in between applicants and informant are strained. In order to seize the stolen goods, custodial interrogation of applicants is warranted. If ad­interim pre­arrest protection is continued then entire investigation would be paralyzed. Therefore he prayed that ad­interim pre­arrest protection granted to these applicants may be vacated and application may be rejected. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3. This Court by an order dated 26/02/2019 has granted ad­interim pre­arrest protection to these applicants only till prosecution appears and files its say. After going through the police papers, it is seen that the Investigating Officer has raised the grievance that applicants are not co­operating with the investigating machinery. After going through the papers and statements of witnesses recorded by Investigating Officer, I find some substance in the arguments of APP because in view of the strained relations in between the parties, nobody else than these applicants was having reason to commit such offence. Moreover, according to APP Mr. Oak when applicant No.2 told the informant that he would get his stolen property back after he pays the rent, this possibility looms large. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4. No doubt there is civil dispute pending in between the parties. But as ad­interim pre­arrest protection is granted to these applicants by this Court specifically by mentioning that it would be till filing of the say by prosecution, that means it was subject to change on APP appears and files his say on the basis of investigation carried till date. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5. When applicants are not co­operating with the investigating machinery as submitted by the APP and Investigating Officer, presence of at­least applicants No.1 and 3 is required by the police to seize the stolen goods. Applicant No.2 being lady, if some conditions are imposed upon her then it would serve the purpose of justice. As such custodial interrogation of applicants No.1 and 3 is certainly warranted in order to seize the stolen goods of informant. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6. Under such circumstances if ad­interim pre­arrest protection granted to applicants No.1 and 3 is continued then entire investigation would be paralyzed. Taking into consideration the nature and seriousness of accusation and for seizure of stolen goods, custodial interrogation of applicants No.1 and 3 would be required. As such application deserves to be partly allowed. Hence the order follows :­ \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER 1 Application is partly allowed. 2 In the event of her arrest in Crime No. 13/2019 registered with Mahabaleshwar Police Station for the offences punishable under sections 454, 457, 380 etc. read with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, applicant No.2 Priti Sagar Chaurasia, be released on anticipatory bail, upon her executing P. R. Bond of Rs.15,000/­ (Rs. fifteen thousands) with one surety in the like amount, on following conditions : i. that she shall attend Mahabaleshwar Police Station on every Thursday and Monday in between 2.00 p.m. to 3.00 p.m. until further orders. ii. that she shall not directly or indirectly, make any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the accusation against her so as to dissuade them from disclosing such facts to the Court or to any police officer. iii. that she shall not threaten informant or witnesses of the prosecution in any way. iv. that she shall not in any manner, make any contact with informant or witnesses. 3 Failure to obey any of the conditions above, would be liable to cancellation of anticipatory bail granted to applicant No.2. 4 Application in respect of applicant No.1 Raju Sandip Pardeshi and applicant No.3 Sagar Chaurasia stands rejected. Ad­interim pre­arrest protection granted to them by this Court vide order dated 26/02/2019 stands cancelled. 5 Inform Mahabaleshwar Police Station accordingly. (Order is dictated and pronounced in the open Court) \r\n---order-ends---\r\nSatara (R.D.Deshpande) Dt.15/04/2019. Additional Sessions Judge, Satara."
