  "processedText": "Bail Appln.No. 253/2019 CNR–MHPUO1-000904-2019 \r\n---header-ends---\r\nORDER BELOW EXH. 1 1. This is an application under Sec. 439 of Cr.P.C. for grant of bail pending trial. 2. As per allegations of the prosecution that one Varsha Kadbane lodged F.I.R. by alleging that on 03.11.2018 at around 11.00 a.m. applicant along with co-accused due to dispute between informant and accused regarding agricultural land at Tilekarwadi gathered near the house of informant and illegally entered the house and burned clothes, bed, cupboard, chairs etc. and also alleged to have burned CBZ motorcycle No. MH-12/FY-6423. So also accused broke the glasses of the informant\u0027s Maruti Suzuki, Celero car and have caused damage to the tune of Rs. 7,00,000/-. Thereafter, C.R.No. 844/2018 has been registered under Sec. 436, 452, 143, 145, 427 of I.P.C. During investigation Sec. 120-B of I.P.C. has been added. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n3. According to applicant he has not committed any offence as alleged by the prosecution. He has been falsely implicated. His name is not mentioned in the F.I.R. No offence is pending against him. Technically investigation has been completed. He is the only earning member of his family and also he is a student. He is ready to abide the terms and conditions imposed by the court. He is permanent resident of Tilekarwadi. The co-accused are released on bail therefore, on the parity ground applicant be released on bail. Thus, applicant prayed for grant of bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4. In response to the show cause notice prosecution has filed its say vide Exh. 5 thereby denied all adverse allegations and reiterated its case. Accused have damaged the vehicles. There is every possibility of dispute between accused and complainant and ... 2 … Bail Appln.No. 253/2019 CNR–MHPUO1-000904-2019 commission of body offence cannot be ruled out. Applicant will pressurize the informant and witnesses. Offence is serious. Investigation is in progress. Thus, prosecution prayed for rejection of the application. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5. Heard Ld.Counsel for the applicants and Ld.A.P.P. for the State. Perused case diary. It appears that as per the story of the prosecution that at around 3.00 p.m while availing the treatment to Dharmendra Tilekar (informant of C.R.No. 842/2018) the brother-in- law of Varsha Kadbane (i.e. informant in present C.R.No. 844/2018) received an unknown call informing him that some unknown persons have burned the house of informant and immediately the informant, father-in-law and other family members immediately rushed to their house and saw that accused along with around 20 -25 persons with mask were present and after seeing the informant and her family members they all ran away from the spot. In short, there grounds for believing that accusation is well founded against the accused. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6. It further appears that on the basis of the report lodged by Dharmendra Tilekar, C.R.No. 842/2018 has been registered against Arjun, Nilesh, Sangita, Rahul, Hemant, Deepak, Kantabai, Varsha i.e. against the Kadbane family. In the said crime informant Dharmendra Tilekar reported to be injured. Thereafter, on the basis of the report lodged by Varsha Kadbane i.e. accused of C.R.No. 842/2018 the C.R.NO. 844/2018 has been registered against the present applicants and other accused. During investigation spot panchanama has been drawn by the I.O. regarding damage to the property and damage to vehicle. It further appears that incriminating material i.e. one plastic can and one plastic bottle containing 1 Ltr. Petrol, wooden log, wooden stick, three vehicles used in the crime has been recovered. It further appears that statement of the witnesses were recorded by the prosecution. In short substantive investigation is already completed. Nothing is to be recovered or discovered at the instance of applicant. It appears that applicant is behind bar from 03.01.2019. He is ready to co-operate the in further investigation and also ready to abide the conditions imposed by the court. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n7. Main purpose of bail is to secure the presence of accused to face the trial. Accused appears to be permanent residents in Pune having roots in the society, therefore, question of their fleeing from justice does not arise. Bail is rule and jail is exception. No useful purpose will suffice by keeping them behind bars till filing of charge- sheet. Furthermore, the accused in C.R.No. 842/2018 under Sec. 307 of I.P.C. F.I.R. lodged by Dharmendra and he is already released on bail. Therefore, applicants can be released on bail with heavy conditions. Thus, following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nO R D E R 1. Cri.Bail Appln. No. 253/2019 is hereby allowed. 2. Applicant Amar Ankush Tilekar in C.R.No. 844/2018 registered with Lonikalbhor Police Station, be released on bail upon furnishing P.R.Bond in the sum of Rs. 25,000/- with one or two solvent sureties in the like amount. 3.
