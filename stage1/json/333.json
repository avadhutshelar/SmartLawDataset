From the complaint of Gulab Uttam Bhandalkar dated 28/12/2018, it reveals that, there are indifferences between complainant, Dayanand Sadashiv Gawade, Vijay Sadashiv Gawade on account of election. There are complaints between them on account of election. On 28.12.2018 at about 05.00 to 06.00 p.m., when complainant was proceeding from Barad–Gunavare road and was near Meeravali Peer, he saw accused No.1 and some unknown persons came from back side of accused No.1 and fired from the back side of complainant by saying that, why complainant is troubling Gawade Saheb. F.I.R. indicates the same story. From the statement of complainant dated 29.12.2018, it reveals that, accused No.1 and two unknown persons came on motorcycle from back side of complainant. Accused No.1 was on one motorcycle and unknown persons were on another motorcycle. Accused No.1 was stating unknown persons that, Gawade Saheb told to assault the complainant and said fact was listened by the complainant. The description of unknown assailants was mentioned in statement dated 29.12.2018. From the statement of Deepak Tembre dated 29.12.2018, it reveals that, on 28.12.2018 from 06.30 a.m. Deepak was in his hotel. At about 05.15 p.m., accused No.1 came to him on his motorcycle and they were discussing in respect of agricultural land. From the statement of Vaishnavi, it reveals that, accused No.1 went to Barad on his motorcycle after sending her at house. From the statement of Prakash Tatyaba Jadhav, dated 30.12.2018, it reveals that, complainant told Prakash that, the persons of Gawade Saheb opened fire on him. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n08. From the remand report dated 16/02/2019, it reveals that, applicant was produced before learned J.M.F.C., Phaltan and P.C.R. was granted till 20/02/2019. On perusal of remand report dated 20/02/2019, it reveals that, M.C.R. was granted to applicant till 06/03/2019. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n09. True that, bail application of accused No.1 bearing No.6/2019 was rejected by this Court. Further true that, Hon\u0027ble High Court, Bombay granted bail to accused No.1 by name Vijay Sadashiv Gawade on 11/02/2019. However, it is necessary to mention here that, on the basis of submission of learned A.P.P. before Hon\u0027ble High Court, Bombay that, there are other four accused arrested in crime where from it revealed that, accused 4 Cri.M.A.No.145 of 2019 (Exh.1) No.1 has not played any active role in the crime in question. That being so, case for grant of bail is made out. On the basis of submission of learned A.P.P. before Hon\u0027ble High Court and as no role was played by accused No.1, he was released on bail by Hon\u0027ble High Court, Bombay on 11/02/2019 in Cri. Bail Appln. No.216/2019. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n10. In the case at hand, allegation levelled against applicant is, he sold two pistols and bullets to accused No.2 and 3. From the say of learned A.P.P. and Police papers, it reveals that, applicant is habitual criminal. Two crimes in respect of illegal possession of fire arms and its sale are registered against him at Ahmednagar and Pune districts. Three theft cases are also registered against applicant. In spite of that, he sold two pistols and bullets to accused No.2 and 3. In my mind, the role of present applicant in alleged offence is to provide two pistols and bullets to accused No.2 and 3 and said pistols and bullets were used while firing towards complainant in which complainant was injured. From the Police papers and say of learned A.P.P., it also reveals that, similar kind of cases are pending against applicant and in spite of that, he dared to sold two pistols and bullets to accused No.2 an 3. Though applicant was not present on the spot of incident, at the time of incident, his role in alleged offence cannot be ignored. Hence, I do not find any substance in the argument of learned Advocate of the applicant that, applicant was not present at the time of incident and there is no direct or indirect evidence against applicant. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n11. In my mind, investigation is in progress, charge­sheet is not yet filed. The alleged offence is serious in nature and if  applicant is released on bail, the possibility cannot be ruled out that, he will misuse his liberty. Prima facie from the record, it reveals that, there is antecedents of applicant. Considering the nature of offence, considering the role played by applicant in alleged offence, considering the antecedents of applicant, I am of the view that, prima facie no case is made out by applicant to release him on bail. Hence, I proceed to pass the following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER Cri. Bail Appln. No.145/2019 is hereby rejected. \r\n---order-ends---\r\nSatara. Date : 17.04.2019. (N.D.Khose) Additional Sessions Judge, Satara."
