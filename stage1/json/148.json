Bail Application No. 183/2019 1. The applicant ­accused has filed present application for anticipatory bail u/s.438 of Cr.P.C. in connection with C.R. No.35/2019 registered with Bharti Vidhyapeeth Police Station for the offences punishable u/s. 353, 504, 506 r/w.s 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 122, 158, 119/177 of the Motor Vehicles Act \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2. Prosecution case is that on 08/01/2019 at about 09­30 p.m., in front of Katraj Police chowky, complainant­ PSI­Bholenath H. Ahiwale was on duty of controlling traffic, at that time, complainant asked to driver i.e. present applicant/accused of Fortuner car bearing registration No.MH/12/QT/0325 to take his vehicle outside PMT Bus depot. At that time, accused No.1­ Pappu Bhandari stated quarreling with complainant by saying that \u0027\u0027 मम गगडम कगढणगर नगहम ततमहगलग मगझम कगय उपटगयचम तत उपटग, मम भगरतमय यतवग सतनतचग पतणत शहर अधययकक आहत\u0027\u0027 and rushed on the person of the complainant and manhandled him, and thereafter, present applicant/accused fled away with the said car from the said place. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3. Learned advocate for applicant/accused submitted that applicant/accused has not committed any offence. He further submitted that custodial interrogation of applicant/accused is not necessary. Investigation is practically completed. He further submitted that there is no allegations against present applicant/accused about he uttered words to police. He further submitted that applicant/accused is permanent resident of Dhankwadi, Pune and he is ready to abide 2 conditions imposed by the court, therefore, he be released on anticipatory bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4. On the other hand learned APP submitted that present applicant/accused after alleged incident along with said car fled away and investigation in respect of same is yet to be completed, therefore, his anticipatory bail application be rejected. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5. On perusing police papers, prima facie, it reveals that on 08/01/2019 at about 09­30, complainant­ PSI­ B. Ahiwale of Bharti Vidhyapeeth Police Station, Pune was on duty at Katraj police chowky, at that time, in the premises of PMT, Fortuner car bearing registration No.MH/12/QT/0325 was illegally parked causing obstruction to the traffic, therefore, he asked driver of the said car to take the said car from that place, at that time, accused­ Pappu Bhandari rushed on the person of complainant and threatened him, resulting to which, buttons of shirt of complainant were broken and thereafter driver of the said car along with car fled away. So far as allegations against present applicant/accused is concerned, it appears that at the relevant time of incident, he has parked impugned vehicle on public place causing obstruction to the traffic and moreover, after alleged incident, he along with the said car fled away from the spot of incident. In the FIR, there is nothing mentioned about present applicant/accused has threatened to the complainant or anything. Therefore, in my view by imposing some conditions i.e. attending the Police Station and to cooperate the Investigating Officer in the investigation, if the present applicant ­accused is released on anticipatory bail, no prejudice will be caused to the prosecution. Hence, application deserves to be allowed. Therefore, I pass the following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER i. Application is allowed. ii. In the event of arrest of applicant ­accused­ Sandip Prabhakar Nivangue, he be released on anticipatory bail on furnishing P.R. Bond in a sum of Rs.25,000/­ (Rs. Twenty five thousand only), with one or two solvent sureties in the like amount. iii. The applicant­ accused shall attend concerned Police Station on every Monday and Thursday between 11 a.m. to 2 p.m and also as and when required by the Investigating Officer and shall co­operate with the Investigation Agency till filing of charge sheet. iv. The applicant­ accused shall not tamper with prosecution evidence. v. The applicant ­accused shall not leave India without permission of the Court. \r\n---order-ends---\r\nDate :­18/01/2019 (K.D.Vadane) Additional Sessions Judge, Pune. 4 “I affirm that the contents of the PDF file order are same word to word as per original judgment.” Name of Steno : Shri S.
