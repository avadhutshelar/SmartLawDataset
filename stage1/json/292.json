  "processedText": "ORDER BELOW EXH.01 IN CRI. MISC. APPLN. NO.100/2019 Rohit Sanjay Kadam Vs. State of Maharashtra CNR­MHST01­000511­2019 \r\n---header-ends---\r\nThis is an application for anticipatory bail as per section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Heard advocate Mr.Barsawade for applicant. He submitted that Crime No. 23/2019 is registered against this applicant with Rahimatpur Police Station for the offences punishable under sections 326 etc. read with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code. Applicant is having strong apprehension of his arrest in this crime. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2. According to him, the FIR lodged by the informant i.e. the cousin brother of applicant is false and concocted and it is by way of counter to the NCR lodged by his mother against applicant. By inviting my attention to the medical papers, he submitted that informant has not sustained any fracture injury. Injuries suferred by him are not grievous. Applicant is the student of B.Sc. Part III. His practical examination is to be conducted shortly. If he is arrested then his reputation would be maligned and his educational career would be spoiled. Therefore he prayed for pre­ arrest protection. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3. After granting ad­interim pre­arrest protection to applicant, notice was issued to the prosecution. APP Mr. Oak by filing his say at Exh.9, strongly resisted the application. He replied that alleged offences are serious. When the informant was proceeding to village Saap on Rahimatpur road, applicant and his unknown associate by coming from backside, assaulted him by means of iron rod, wooden log and chopper. In the incident, informant sustained grievous injuries on his head, back, hand and legs. This incident took place on account of previous quarrels in between the mother of applicant and informant. Applicant has also given threats to the informant of dire consequences. Applicant, informant and witnesses are residents of the same village. Moreover applicant is the cousin brother of informant. Taking into consideration their relationship, possibility of repetition of crime cannot be ruled out. Weapons and vehicles used in the commission of offences are to be seized and therefore he submitted that custodial interrogation of this applicant is necessary. He therefore prayed for rejection of bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4. However, during the course of arguments he fairly submitted that after primary treatment given to informant at the Rural Hospital, Koregaon, he was referred to Gourishankar Diagnostic and Research Center, Satara. After performing CT Scan, it is revealed that informant did not sustain any fracture injury. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5. In view of non­sustaining of fracture injury to informant, a query was made by this Court to the applicant whether the offence which falls under section 324 of the Indian Penal Code is bailable or non­bailable. Advocate Mr. Barsawade for applicant placed his reliance on the case of Chandra Kanjappa Kuchikurwe Vs. State of Maharashtra, reported in 2013 ALL MR (Cri) 626, in which it is held by Hon\u0027ble Bombay High Court that by amendment of 2005 to the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, an offence under section 324 of the Indian Penal Code is made non­bailable. However, the facts show that the date is not notified by the Central Government on which the said provision would come into picture and thus the Hon\u0027ble Bombay High Court held that since an offence punishable under section 324 of the Indian Penal Code is bailable, the provisions of section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 are not applicable to it. In view of this position, advocate Mr. Barsawade for applicant prayed that finding may be recorded by this Court to that effect while passing order so that he can move the JMFC Court for regular bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6. Considering the fact that applicable is the B.Sc. last year student of Y.C. College, Satara and who appears to be having good moral character and that incident in question took place since the informant raised quarrel with his mother, ad­interim pre­ arrest protection was granted to him. So far as other offence punishable under section 506 of the Indian Penal Code is concerned, it is not covered by the later part of section 506 as there are no threats with life injury by applicant to the informant. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n7. As discussed earlier, from the papers on record, offence punishable under section 324 of the Indian Penal Code is made out and not under section 326. Since both the offences registered against this applicant are bailable, applicant is not entitled for pre­ arrest protection from this Court. He is at liberty to move the JMFC concerned for regular bail. Hence the order follows :­ \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER 1 Application is rejected. 2 Ad­interim pre­arrest protection granted to applicant by this Court by way of order dated 11/02/2019 is hereby canceelled. 3 Inform the lower Court and concerned Police Station accordingly. (Order is dictated and pronounced in the open Court) \r\n---order-ends---\r\nSatara (R.D.Deshpande) Dt.11/03/2019. Additional Sessions Judge, Satara."
