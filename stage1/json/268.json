  "processedText": "ORDER BELOW EXH.01 IN CRI. MISC. APPLN. NO. 73/2019 MHST01­000388­2018 Bhauso Popat Tawar etc.2 Vs. State of Maharashtra \r\n---header-ends---\r\nThis is an application for regular bail as per section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Heard advocate Mr. R. A. Nikam for applicants. He submitted that in Crime No. 217/2018 registered with Rahimatpur Police Station for the offences punishable under sections 420, 406 read with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, applicants are behind the bars since 25/01/2019. They were remanded in police custody for three days and since then they are in Magisterial custody. Part of their custodial interrogation is over. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2. By inviting my attention to the FIR, he submitted that both the applicants have not at all cheated either informant or others. They have paid the collected money under the scheme \u0027the World Trust the Money\u0027, Lonavala, District – Pune to its official Manish Lokaras. There was no intention on their part either to cheat the informant or others. They are local residents. Applicant No.2 is suffering from various ailments. There is no reason to keep them behind the bars. They are ready to obey with all the conditions those may be imposed upon them. They are ready to furnish solvent surety to the satisfaction of this Court and to help the investigation machinery. Therefore he submitted that applicants may be released on bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3. APP Mr. Muke by filing say at Exh.10 strongly resisted the application. He submitted that both the applicants induced the group of women for the scheme of domestic employment by the company namely \u0027the World Trust the Money\u0027, Lonavala, District – Pune. Thereby they have collected an amount of Rs.2,47,380/­ from the various groups of women at the rate of Rs.651/­ each per group. But after some time, the informant and other women group came to know that both the applicants have cheated them by inducing them to pay the huge amount of Rs.2,47,380/­. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4. According to him, all the offences are serious. Huge amount of Rs.2,47,380/­ is yet to be seized. Applicants are involved in similar type of offences with Kadegaon and Karad Taluka Police Stations and bail applications filed by them before the respective Courts, came to be rejected. If applicants are released on bail then they are likely to tamper with the evidence of prosecution. Investigation which is in progressive stage would be badly hampered. Thorough investigation is necessary taking into consideration the gravity of offences. Therefore he submitted that application may be rejected. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5. After going through the FIR lodged by informant, it is seen that he was the applicant No.2 who for the time and again forced him by inducing him to form the groups of women for domestic employment for manufacturing paper bags and packets, envelopes etc. Thereby various groups of women were formed and he with the help of applicant No.1 by inducing the various groups of women have collected an amount of Rs.651/­ per group from various groups total worth Rs.2,47,380/­. No doubt the FIR shows that entire amount is handed over by these applicants to the office bearer namely Manish Lokaras of that company \u0027the World Trust the Money\u0027, Lonavala, District – Pune. But both these applicants have collected the amounts from various women groups. Official Manish Lokaras did not personally make any contact with the group of women. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6. Therefore considering the averments in the FIR, it is seen that both the applicants seems to have played major role in the commission of alleged offences. Though they have undergone custodial interrogation, the amount collected by them to the tune of Rs.2,47,380/­ is yet to be recovered. The say filed by the prosecution also hints that similar type of offences are registered against these applicants with Kadegaon and Karad Taluka Police Stations. It shows the antecedents of these applicants. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n7. Considering the progressive stage of investigation coupled with nature and seriousness of accusation, it would not be just and safe to release them on bail at this stage. If they are released on bail then they are likely to tamper with the evidence of prosecution and thereby entire investigation would be paralyzed. Considering the gravity of offences, reasonable opportunity is required to be given to investigation machinery to carry out investigation in its proper perspective. As such both the applicants do not deserve to be released on bail. If applicant No.2 is suffering from any ailment then there is facility of medical treatment in every jail nowadays. He can take recourse of such facility with the help of Superintendent of concerned prison. Application deserves to be rejected. Hence the order follows :­ \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER Application is rejected. (Order is dictated and pronounced in the open Court) \r\n---order-ends---\r\nSatara (R.D.Deshpande) Dt.14/02/2019. Additional Sessions Judge, Satara."
