The allegation in FIR is that, applicants were insisting the repayment of loan to the deceased and for that purpose they were causing harassment of deceased by beating him. However, from the VDO clip it seems that, deceased is not making allegation of harassment for repayment of loan but he is making allegation of beating as he caused accident of the tractor and trolly of the applicant of no. 1 he stated that, he was ready to compensate the damage caused to the tractor and trally. From VDO clip is seems that, deceased has made statement that the minor girl who lodged FIR against him of offence p/u/s 379 had herself called the deceased and he had done nothing. Copy of FIR registered against the deceased is reflecting that the minor informant in said case has alleged that, deceased had committed offence p/u/s 376 of IPC. From allegations made in VDO clip as well as FIR is seems that, the allegation mentioned in FIR is imaginary on the contrary possibility of arrest of deceased was there in respect of offence registered against him. It seems that applicant no. 1 has informed about the damage to his tractor and trolly due to the act of deceased and it seems that, since said accident deceased was abscond. Thus, there is no abatement as alleged by the applicants. Moreover, in view of allegations against the applicants their custodial interrogation is not required. Hence, the order passed below exh. 4 may be confirmed. The conditions imposed in said order may be continued till filing of charge­sheet. Hence, the order.",

State of Maharashtra) CNR : MHST01-000663-2019 \r\n---header-ends---\r\n1) Accused have filed this application for anticipatory bail. It is contended that, the offence is registered against the accused in Phaltan Gramin Police Station vide C.R.No. 62/2019 in respect of offence pun/u/S. 306, 323, 504, 506 r/w 34 of I.P.C. and Sections 39, 45 of Bombay Money Lenders Act 1946. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2) It is further contended that, Applicants are the resident of village sangvi Tal ­Phaltan Dist Satara doing agriculture business. Applicant no. 1 doing transport business of sugar­cane to sugar factory, deceased was working as driver of applicant no. 1. It is further stated that 15 families, other state were working with tractor trolly of applicant no. 1 and they were retiring in temporary shed. It is alleged on 10­2­19 deceased entered in the one of the hut of worker during night time and committed rape on minor girl, said incident was informed to applicant no. 1 by the workers thereupon he went to the spot and called the deceased but he ran away. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3) It is further stated that, FIR is not disclosing abatement of suicide, deceased was addicted to liquor, he committed suicide by recording VDO by cell phone stating that, applicants are responsible for the suicide. It is further stated that, applicant will not abscond and they will remain present as and when called for the purpose of investigation, there is no criminal history of applicants, they are the earning members of their family and they are ready to abide by the conditions imposed. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4) Prosecution filed say exh. 16 and opposed the application. It is further stated that, deceased has borrowed the amount of Rs. 80,000/ from applicant with interest at the rate of Rs. 10% per month for repayment of loan taken for marriage of his niece, applicant were constantly harassing deceased for principle amount they were beating and threating for lodging report of outrage of modesty and due to constant harassment deceased committed suicide. It is further stated that, deceased prior to suicide prepared VDO clip and sent it on social medial whats­up wherein he clearly stated the names of applicant and harassment caused by them. On 13­2­2019 body of deceased found in hanging condition, investigation is in progress prayed for dismissal of application. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5) Informant who lodged FIR filed her affidavit alleging that, applicants were harassing her husband for the amount obtained from them, they were claiming interest at higher rate. It is also alleged that, accused were not arrested due to political pressure even police were insisting her to withdraw the case. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6) Heard advocate for applicant Shri. Narkar and Ld. APP. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n7) I have gone through the FIR also watched the VDO clip prepared by deceased of his own. The allegation in FIR is that, applicants were insisting the repayment of loan to the deceased and for that purpose they were causing harassment of deceased by beating him. However, from the VDO clip it seems that, deceased is not making allegation of harassment for repayment of loan but he is making allegation of beating as he caused accident of the tractor and trolly of the applicant of no. 1 he stated that, he was ready to compensate the damage caused to the tractor and trally. From VDO clip is seems that, deceased has made statement that the minor girl who lodged FIR against him of offence p/u/s 379 had herself called the deceased and he had done nothing. Copy of FIR registered against the deceased is reflecting that the minor informant in said case has alleged that, deceased had committed offence p/u/s 376 of IPC. From allegations made in VDO clip as well as FIR is seems that, the allegation mentioned in FIR is imaginary on the contrary possibility of arrest of deceased was there in respect of offence registered against him. It seems that applicant no. 1 has informed about the damage to his tractor and trolly due to the act of deceased and it seems that, since said accident deceased was abscond. Thus, there is no abatement as alleged by the applicants. Moreover, in view of allegations against the applicants their custodial interrogation is not required. Hence, the order passed below exh. 4 may be confirmed. The conditions imposed in said order may be continued till filing of charge­sheet. Hence, the order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER 1) Criminal Bail Application no. 128/2019, is allowed. 2) Interim pre­arrest bail order dated 22/02/2019 passed below Exh. 4, stands confirmed. \r\n---order-ends---\r\n(B.S.Wavre) Place : Satara Addl.
