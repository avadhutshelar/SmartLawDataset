This an application for grant of anticipatory bail filed by the applicants under Section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n02. Brief facts of the applicant\u0027s case are as under. That one Sunil Tukaram Kale, aged 52 years, lodged complaint in the Police Station and alleged that, he along with his wife is residing in Gat No.32, Nisarg Bungalow, Bhogaon, Taluka Wai, District Satara. Both of them are Artists by profession. It is contended by him that, in the year 2014 he had purchased 18 gunthas agricultural land from Gat No.32 of village Bhogaon under a registered sale deed from Siddhi Sunil Yelkar, resident of Wai. After purchase he had got measured the said property from the Office of Land Records. Thereafter in the year 2016 he has got the agricultural land transferred into non agricultural land and thereafter constructed two houses by obtaining necessary permission. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n03. It is contended by the first informant that, on 02.04.2016, at about 01.30 p.m. while the construction work was going on in the aforesaid land, the present applicants accused along with other accused came there armed with axe and created terror. They abused the first informant on her caste and threatened to not to erect construction. On 09.09.2016 one Ramesh Sanas had filed an application with the Tahasildar, Wai for stopping the construction work of first informant. He had also filed an application for getting ten feet wide road from the bandh of Gat No.32 and 41 which came to be rejected. On 16.11.2016 against Ramesh Sanas had filed an application with the Dhom Irrigation Department against the first informant contending therein that he had stopped the water flowing 2 from the channel and moved the same in his field due to which he had sustained loss. Thereafter one Chandrakant Sanas had filed suit bearing No.4 of 2017 in Wai Court praying therein to get damages of Rs.50,000/­ caused to him. So also Rajkumar Sanas had also filed suit No.7 of 2017 contending therein that the first informant is doing illegal construction. Rajkumar Sanas had also filed an application against the first informant contending therein that he had cut trees valuing Rs.50,000/­ and thereby caused damage and suit No.186 of 2016 is also filed in that respect. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n04. Thereafter, on 03.12.2018, the first informant had called one Rajendra Gole to work as a labour. Said labour was also threatened by the accused. The accused abused the first informant on his caste saying him as “ हयय चयचभयरडययलय ययथथन हयकलथनच लयवलय पयहहजय\". It is also contended that the accused threaten the persons who come for work in the land of first informant. Accordingly the first informant went in the Police Station and lodged complaint against the accused. Police have registered C.R.No.38 of 2019 for the offences punishable under Section 143, 147, 149, 336, 504, 506 of the Indian Penal Code r/w Section 3(1)(g)(p)(r)(s), 3(2)(5­a) and 6 of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n05. The applicant contended that, there are eight accused. The accused No.1, 3, 5, 7 are male. They were arrested by police and released on bail by the Court. The present applicants are accused No.2, 4, 6 and 8. They are women and they are innocent, not involved in the crime. Their names are implicated on the count of previous enmity between them. There is dispute regarding land. C.R.No.38 of 2019 and RCS No.4 of 2017, 7 of 2017, RCC No.186 of 2016, RCS No.81 of 2011, RCC No.1 of 2012 are pending between 3 them in Wai Court. Hence, they are entitled for bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n06. Learned A.P.P. for State strongly opposed the application by filing say at Exh.6 and contended that, as per Section 18­A of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act the provisions of Section 438 shall not apply and, therefore, application is liable to be rejected. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n07. The first informant has filed her say at Exh.7 and contended that, all accused are residing adjacent to their house, belong to higher caste, they abused on caste “चयचभयरडयय\" and humiliated them. Not only this, the are also trying to dispossess them from the peaceful possession of the land purchased by him. All the male and female members of the family took active part in the incident of abusing on caste and continuously trying to disturb the possession of the land. If they are released on anticipatory bail, they will tamper the evidence of prosecution and will pressurise the prosecution witnesses. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n08. Heard learned Advocate for accused and leraned A.P.P. for State. Perused the application, say, FIR on record. The applicants are relied on the judgment of Hon\u0027ble High Court in Criminal Appeal No.1173 of 2018 decided on 31.10.2018 Sunil Mandevrao Thombre (Bavdhankar) and others Vs. State of Maharashtra and another wherein it is held that in case if the prima facie case is not made out against the accused, then there is no bar of Section 18 of the Act to release the accused on anticipatory bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n09. I have gone through the FIR. It appears that, the accused and first informant are resident of same locality. Their plots are 4 adjacent to each other. The first informant has purchased land Gat No.32 admeasuring 18 gunthas from Siddhi Yelkar of Wai by registered sale deed. After obtaining necessary permission started construction over the land. The accused No.1 to 8 created terror and obstructed the construction work, therefore, the first informant went in the Police Station, lodged several complaints, also filed Civil Suit against the accused. Same are pending in Wai Court. FIR further discloses that, the accused in furtherance of their common intention abused the first informant on the caste, stated that, “चयचभयरडयय\", also uprooted the compound and threatened to kill if not vacated the land. The accused have not only committed offence of 3(1)(r)(s) but also 3(1)(g) of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. They are trying to dispossess the first informant from the lawful possession of land who is member of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes. The offence is serious, requires further investigation and interrogation of the accused. Hence, I proceed to pass the following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER Application stands rejected. \r\n---order-ends---\r\nSatara. Date : 21.06.2019. (Anis A. J. Khan) Addl. Sessions Judge, Satara."
