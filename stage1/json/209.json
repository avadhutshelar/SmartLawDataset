  "processedText": "1/5 Criminal Misc. Application No. 9/2019 Nitin Kushaba Lavangare Vs. State of Maharashtra \r\n---header-ends---\r\nORDER BELOW EXH.01 IN CRI. MISC. APPLN. NO. 9/2019 This is an application for anticipatory bail as per section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Perused application and the documents placed on record. Heard advocate Mr. Dhaigude for applicant. He submitted that Crime No.357/2018 is registered against this applicant with Koregaon Police Station for the offence punishable under section 354 of the Indian Penal Code. He is having strong apprehension of his arrest in this crime. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2. He invited my attention to the documents produced along­with list at Exh.3 and submitted that on the date of incident, in fact this applicant who belongs to the Scheduled Caste was severely beaten by the informant by means of knife. By taking primary treatment at Primary Health Center at Kinhai, he was referred to Yashwant Hospital, Satara. The type of injury suffered by him is serious. But as a counter blast, the informant has lodged false and concocted FIR against him. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3. He also invited my attention to the FIR in which there is allegation of holding hand of the informant by this applicant and threats. According to him, applicant is still undergoing medical treatment. Under such situation, if he is arrested then he would suffer an irreparable loss and his reputation is also likely to be maligned. Therefore he prayed that ad­interim pre­arrest protection granted to this applicant may be confirmed. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4. APP Mrs. Diwakar by filing say at Exh.14 strongly resisted the application. She replied that allegations in the FIR are serious. Applicant has insulted the modesty of the informant in the broad day light and in the market. Applicant and informant are residing just adjacent to each other in the same village. Though the informant is married and having children, still applicant is harassing her for the time and again. If he is released on anticipatory bail then he is likely to repeat such type of offence in future also. Custodial interrogation of this applicant is necessary by the police for investigation. Therefore she prayed that application may be rejected. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5. In reply, advocate Mr. Dhaigude invited my attention to the medical papers and submitted that informant has assaulted this applicant by means of knife. He has sustained injury which is grievous in nature. In fact there is danger to the life of this applicant at the hands of informant and her relatives. After granting pre­arrest protection, he has not at all disobeyed any of the conditions imposed upon him by this Court and he would obey those conditions in future also. He belongs to scheduled caste. He has also filed FIR against the informant and her relatives under the provisions of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. Therefore he submitted that considering the allegations in the FIR, his custodial interrogation is not at all necessary and therefore ad­interim pre­arrest protection granted to him may be confirmed. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6. After going through the averments in the FIR and taking into consideration the fact of lodging of the counter FIR by this applicant against informant and her relatives and grievous injury sustained by this applicant, this Court has already granted ad­interim pre­arrest protection to him on 05/01/2019. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n7. As per the directions of this Court, applicant is marking his presence before the Investigating Officer. Say filed by the prosecution nowhere reflects that after granting ad­interim pre­ arrest protection, applicant has disobeyed any of the conditions imposed upon him. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n8. Considering the allegations in the FIR, custodial interrogation of this applicant is not at all warranted as there is nothing which is to be seized from him. Moreover taking into consideration the nature and seriousness of accusation and the fact that informant has inflicted grievance injury upon applicant, he deserves for confirmation of ad­interim pre­arrest protection granted to him by this Court by an order below application at Exh.4. He is already directed that he shall not make any contact with the informant and witnesses of the prosecution in any manner and Koregaon police station is already informed accordingly to keep watch upon him. As such, ad­interim pre­arrest protection granted to applicant vide order below application at Exh.4 deserves to be confirmed on the same conditions. Hence the order follows :­ \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER 1 Application is allowed. 2 In the event of his arrest in Crime No. 357/2018 registered with Koregaon Police Station for the offence punishable under section 354 of the Indian Penal Code, applicant Nitin Kushaba Lavangare, be released on anticipatory bail, upon his executing P. R. Bond of Rs.15,000/­ (fifteen thousands) with one surety in the like amount, on following conditions : i. that he shall attend Koregaon Police Station on every Tuesday in between 11.00 a.m. to 1.00 p.m. without fail until further orders. ii. that he shall not directly or indirectly, make any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the accusation against him so as to dissuade them from disclosing such facts to the Court or to any police officer. iii. that he shall not threaten informant or witnesses of the prosecution in any way. iv. he shall not make any contact with the informant in any manner. 3 Failure to obey any of the conditions above, would be liable to cancellation of ad­interim anticipatory bail granted to applicant. 4 Inform Koregaon Police Station accordingly. \r\n---order-ends---\r\n(Order is dictated and pronounced in the open Court) Satara (R.D.Deshpande) Dt.16/03/2019. Additional Sessions Judge, Satara."
