  "processedText": "Cri.Bail Appln.No.175/2019 ORDER PASSED BELOW EXH.1 IN CRIMINAL BAIL APPLICATION NO.175/2019 \r\n---header-ends---\r\n1] Applicant Vishal Baban Nimbalkar apprehending arrest in Crime No. 88/2018 registered at Paud Police Station in respect of offences punishable under Sections 307, 326, 143, 147, 148,149, 341, 452, 504, 506 of the Indian Penal Code and under Section 4 (27) of the Arms Act, has approached this Court and prayed for anticipatory bail. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2] Perused the application, record of the case. Heard the ld. advocate U.B.Nalawade appearing on behalf of the applicant. He prayed for interim anticipatory bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3] On perusal of record, it seems that the FIR dated 01.04.2018 is filed by Mangesh Kangude. According to him, due to previous enmity on 31.03.2018 at about 11.30 p.m. the applicant and co­accused armed with sword, iron rod, sticks, hockey sticks entered in his house, committed house trespass. They abused and started assaulting informant. Co­accused Tushar Jadhav assaulted him by means of iron rod on head, which was saved by the informant by means of hand. The applicant and other co­accused assaulted by means of fist and kick blows. The other family members of the informant were also assaulted while separating the quarrel. They caused damage to the household articles and left the spot. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4] The informant, thereafter heard noise outside his house near shop of Mr. Shinde. He, therefore, rushed along with his cousin Akshay towards the spot and found that Shubham sustained head injury and his brother Akshay and Ganesh were standing near him. Akshay told him that co­ accused Pintu assaulted Shubham by sword on his head. He also informed that when he and Ganesh tried to rescue Shubham, they were also assaulted by stick and hockey stick by applicant and other co­accused. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5] According to Ld. advocate for applicant, offence punishable under sections 307, 337 of the Indian Penal Code is not made out. He has been falsely implicated. He has no previous antecedents. Charge­sheet is already filed. His custodial interrogation is not necessary. Hence prayed for bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6] I have considered his submissions. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n7] The name of the applicant is specifically mentioned in the FIR. There are specific allegations that the applicant was armed with stick, assaulted the informant and other witnesses. The weapon used in commission of offence is yet to be seized. Therefore, in my opinion, his custodial interrogation is necessary. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n8] Bail application No.2439/2018 of co­accused Abhimanyu Jadhav, who played same role, has been rejected by the Hon\u0027ble Bombay High Court. 9] As the applicant is not entitled for anticipatory bail, in view of language of Section 438(1) of the Cr.P.C., there is no question of grant of interim anticipatory bail. Hence the following order : \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER The application is rejected. \r\n---order-ends---\r\nSd/­ Place : Pune. ( A.N.Sirsikar ) Date : 01.02.2019.
