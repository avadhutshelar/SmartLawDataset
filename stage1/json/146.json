Her house is searched but no incriminating material was found. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4] The learned APP Shri. Salvi submitted as per their say. He submitted that applicant joined as Accountant on monthly payment of Rs. 8000/­. Her monthly salary is time to time increased and she was drawing Rs. 16000/­ p.m. in the year 2015.

The said sheet since in respect of withdrawal by cash or by self withdrawal, since 2010 – 2011 till 2017­2018.

Merely because, the applicant had purchased row house and flat of huge amount, it cannot be said that she has misappropriated the amount from the complainant company. Documents are lying with the bank. Computer might be lying with the company of the complainant. Therefore, in my view custodial interrogation of the applicant accused is not required.
