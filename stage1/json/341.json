State of Maharashtra \r\n---header-ends---\r\nThis is an application for regular bail as per section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Heard advocate Mr. A. K. Shinde, for applicant. He submitted that in Crime No.36/2019 registered with Rahimatpur Police Station for the offences punishable under sections 307 etc. of the Indian Penal Code, applicant is behind the bars since 24/02/2019. \r\n---background-ends---\r\nHe has undergone custodial interrogation for three days and thereafter he is in Magisterial custody. Investigation is practically completed. Further presence of this applicant is no more required by the police. He is local resident. He has no antecedents. He is running grocery shop in the village and is also doing agriculture. He is ready to obey with all the conditions those may be imposed upon him. Therefore he submitted that by imposing certain conditions, applicant may be released on bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n2. APP Mr. Oak by filing his say at Exh.13 strongly resisted the application. He submitted that in the FIR, there are allegations that applicant assaulted son of the informant namely Ganesh by means of sickle. But during the course of investigation, it revealed that no sickle was used, but it was the wooden log. It came to be seized at the instance of this applicant. Injury sustained by the injured Ganesh during the incident is simple in nature. If applicant is released on bail then there is possibility of repetition of such type of offences at his hands. He is likely to tamper with the evidence of prosecution and therefore he submitted that application may be rejected. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3. In reply, advocate Mr. Shinde submitted that injured himself is the person having criminal background. He used to harass this applicant under influence of liquor, by asking to give the grocery articles on credit. He is already indebted to him. But when applicant asked him about the due amount, he lodged false FIR. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4. After going through the investigation papers, it is seen that though in the FIR there are allegations of causing hurt by means of sickle, it is revealed that no sickle was used, but it was the wooden log and which came to be seized when this applicant was in custody. Applicant has already undergone custodial interrogation. He is behind the bars since last about one month. By this time, investigation might have been practically completed, as the panchanama of the spot is prepared, weapon used in the commission of offence is seized. Injury sustained by the injured Ganesh is simple in nature as is certified by the Medical Officer. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5. Further presence of this applicant is no more required by the police. He is local resident and is running grocery shop as well as doing agriculture. Therefore there is no possibility of his absconding. If some stringent conditions are imposed then it would serve the purpose of prosecution. There is no propriety in keeping this applicant behind the bars for an inordinate period as the trial is not likely to commence in near future. Hence the order follows :­ \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER 1 Application is allowed. 2 In Crime No. 36/2019 registered with Rahimatpur Police Station for the offences punishable under sections 307 etc. of the Indian Penal Code, applicant Lalasaheb Shankar Kenjale, be released on bail upon his executing P.R.
