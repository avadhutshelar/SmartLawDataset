Perused application. Heard learned Advocate Shri.D.B.Kadam for the applicants and learned A.P.P. Shri.N.D.Muke for State. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n03. From the contents of complaint of Nitin Mugut Vhatkar dated 02.01.2017 in C.R.No.2 of 2017, it reveals that, on 02.01.2017, at about 12.30 p.m., after Biroba wasti on the road Vishal Uttam Shelke, Sagar Kolekar, Ganesh Sopan Shelke (applicant No.2) Yuvraj Rangnath Shelke, Tushar Uttam Shelke, Pawan Bapurao Waghmode, Yuvraj Shelke, Sagar Maruti Shelke, Dada Shelke, Ajay Shelke, Nilesh Shelke, Ganesh Dattatraya Shelke, Suraj Shelke, Pravin Shelke, Sunil Doiphode (applicant No.1) and other three to four persons were standing and they were armed with iron rod, sticks, sword, koyta. Pawan and Nilesh were armed with swords. One small tempo was standing near the road. Vishal and Tushar stopped the complainant and started to abuse and assault him. Vishal assaulted Bhausaheb with iron rod on his back side. Pawan assaulted Bhausaheb by sword on his head. Vishal and Ganesh assaulted complainant with iron rod on his left hand, right hand, right thigh and Bajrang Masal, Vijay Dhaigude, Rama Mahanawar, Mohan Dhaigude, Ramesh Jawale, Anna Govekar came there and accused assaulted Bajrang, Anna and others. Vijay Dhaigude intervened into the quarrel. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n04. From the contents of application, it reveals that, custodial interrogation is not necessary. Applicants are not history sheeter nor they are previously convicted. Main assailants are already released on anticipatory bail in Bail Application No.7 of 2017 and 8 of 2017 on 01.02.2017, hence principle of parity is applicable to applicants. Charge­sheet has been filed. No role is attributed to applicant No.1 and general allegations are levelled against him. The supplementary statement of complainant was recorded on 06.01.2017 in which he stated that, applicant No.2 was not present on the spot of incident. Applicants are falsely involved. Applicants are permanent resident of Nimbodi, Taluka Khandala, District Satara. There is no likelihood that applicants will abscond. Applicants are ready to abide any condition, if so imposed by the Court. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n05. From the say of learned A.P.P. at Exh.11, it reveals that, on account of previous quarrel, 15 accused persons assembled together with preparation to assault complainant and witnesses. Accused persons including applicants were possessing deadly weapons such as sword, sickle, iron rod and sticks in their hands. They assaulted complainant, witnesses Nitin Vhatkar, Bhauso Masal and Anna Govekar. They sustained grievous injuries. In the event of release on bail, applicants are likely to pressurise the witnesses by threats and by muscle power. So also repetition of crime cannot be ruled out. Since the date of offence, applicants are absconding. On this ground alone, applicants are not entitled for bail. In case of bail, applicants will not attend the Court during the trial and shall tamper the witnesses. Therefore, considering the case of direct evidence, it is not case for grant of anticipatory bail and prayed to reject the application. 06. Learned Advocate for applicants prayed to allow the application. Per contra, learned A.P.P. prayed to reject the application. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n07. Gone through the documents filed by applicants. From the record it reveals that, charge­sheet is filed and the same is bearing Regular Criminal Case No.63 of 2017. On perusal of record it reveals that, on 06.01.2017, the supplementary statement of complainant was recorded in which complainant stated that, applicant No.2 by name Ganesh Sopan Shelke was not present on the spot of incident. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n08. On perusal of record it further came to my notice that, while passing order below Exh.1 in Cri.M.A.No.7 of 2017 and Cri.M.A.No.8 of 2017 dated 01.02.2017 the main assailants are released on anticipatory bail. While passing order in Cri.M.A.No.7 of 2017 and Cri.M.A.No.8 of 2017 it was observed by the then Additional Sessions Judge, Satara, that, custodial interrogation of applicants is not necessary by further observing that, counter case is filed against the informant and others wherein anticipatory bail has been granted in C.R.No.2 of 2017. Applicants are resident of village Nimbodi, Taluka Khandala and, as such, there is no likelihood of their absconding. The charges levelled against applicants are triable by Magistrate. The apprehension of prosecution that, applicants will pressurise the witnesses can be taken care by imposing conditions. Necessary to mention here that, the main assailants are released on anticipatory bail. From the supplementary statement of complainant dated 06.01.2017, it reveals that, applicant No.2 was not present on the spot of incident. From the complaint, it reveals that, no specific role is attributed by applicant No.1 by name Sunil Bapurao Doiphode. In such circumstances, I think that, principle of parity is applicable to applicants. Hence, I proceed to pass the following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nO R D E R 1. Application is allowed. 2. In the event of the arrest of applicants in C.R.No.2 of 2017 registered with Lonand Police Station for the offences punishable under Sections 143, 147, 149, 341, 326, 324, 323, 504, 506 of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 4, 25 of the Arms Act, applicants, namely, Sunil Bapurao Doiphode and Ganesh Sopan Shelke be released on anticipatory bail upon their executing PR Bond of Rs.15,000/­ with one surety in the like amount on the following conditions. (a) Applicants shall not directly or indirectly make any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the accusation against them so as to dissuade him / her from disclosing such facts to the investigating agency or to the Court. (b) Applicants shall not threaten the informant or the witnesses of the prosecution in any manner. 3. Failure on the part of applicant to obey any of the conditions above would be ground for cancellation of anticipatory bail granted to them. \r\n---order-ends---\r\nSatara. Date : 16.03.2019. (N.D.Khose) Additional Sessions Judge, Satara."
