Respondent. \r\n---header-ends---\r\nORDER BELOW EXH.1 This is the first bail application by accused Mohammad Hussain Ismail Shaikh and others for regular bail under section 439 of Cr. P. C. in connection with CR No.93/2019, registered by Shivajinagar police station, for the offence punishable under section 353, 504, 506 r/w 34 of the Indian Penal Code. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n[2] Perused the application and say given. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[3] Heard learned advocate Mr. Raheel Malik for the applicants and APP Mr. Aurangabadkar for the State. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[4] The learned advocate for the accused / applicants argued that accused / applicants are members of NGO and they had been to the office of informant for discussion regarding the encroachment removal action initiated by the corporation. There were peaceful talks. No incident, as alleged had taken place. The applicants / accused have no criminal antecedents. They are law abiding citizens and ready to abide any condition if imposed. The accused / applicants are behind bar for more than seven to eight days. They may be released on bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[5] The learned APP argued that the offence in question is serious in nature. The accused / applicants have taken law in their hand for obstructing the public servant from discharging their official duties. He prayed for rejection of the application. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[6] I have gone through the FIR, reply given by the prosecution and the other papers produced for my perusal. There are no allegations of assault against any public servant. It appears that there were exchange of words and there was heated argument. Having regard to the nature of the offence and the period for which the accused are in jail, I find no further purpose will be served by keeping the accused / applicants in jail. Hence, the following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER [1] The application is allowed. [2] The applicant no.[1] Mohammad Hussain Ismail Shaikh, [2] Kashinath Baburao Gaikwad, [3] Mahadev Ashok Rasal, [4] Abba Balasaheb Aute, are released on bail, on their executing PR Bond of Rs.15,000/­ each, with one surety of like amount, in connection with C.R.No. 93/2019 registered by Shivajinagar police station, on following conditions :­ [A] The applicants / accused shall not tamper with the prosecution evidence in any manner. [B] The applicants / accused shall co­operate the investigating agency during investigation and they shall not repeat any offence. [3] Bail before concerned JMFC.
