Informant is Police Constable as such he cannot be pressurized at the hand of applicant. Moreover, when applicant was first time produced before J.M.F.C., Phaltan, M.C.R. was sought for which shows that personal interrogation with accused by Police is not necessary. Applicant is in jail from 23/02/2019. 08. Considering the nature of offence, considering the punishment provided for alleged offence, keeping in mind that applicant is not previously convicted, I am of the view that, it would be just, proper and judicious to release the applicant on bail by imposing some conditions on him so that he will not misuse his liberty.

Applicant, namely, Dattatraya Anna Manjule by this application under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure pray for bail in C.R.No.83 of 2019 registered with Phaltan Rural Police Station under Sections 379, 511, 353 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. 02. Perused the application and say filed by the prosecution at Exh.7. Gone through the investigation papers. Heard learned Advocate for the applicant and the learned A.P.P. for the State. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n03. According to applicant, he is falsely implicated. Applicant never used physical force against informant. Applicant was arrested on 22/02/2019 and was produced before the Magistrate on 23/02/2019 and since 23/02/2019, he is in M.C.R. Custodial interrogation of applicant is not necessary. Applicant is sole earning hand of his family and his family members are dependent on him. Applicant is ready to abide by any condition if so imposed by the Court. Applicant is ready to cooperate with the investigation agency and will not misuse his liberty. Applicant is permanent resident of Algudewadi, Tal. Phaltan. Applicant prayed to allow the application. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n04. From the say of learned A.P.P. at Exh.7 it reveals that, informant is Police Constable of Phaltan Gramin Police Station. On 21/02/2019, informant was on patrolling duty. At that time, he saw theft of sand and its filling in the trolley of tractor. He stopped the applicant and asked for license to applicant. Applicant was not having license. Applicant was taken to Police Station and he behaved with informant arrogantly. Applicant parked his tractor in Police Station campus and fled away along with tractor trolley by taking disadvantage of darkness. Applicant is tractor driver bearing No. MH11­5094. Applicant prevented informant when informant was performing his duty as public servant. Tractor and trolley is seized. Investigation is in progress. Possibility of repetition of crime as well as pressuring witnesses cannot be ruled out. Learned A.P.P. prayed to reject the application. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n05. It is vehemently argued by the learned Advocate for the applicant that, tractor and trolley used in alleged offence has been seized in investigation. Personal interrogation of applicant is not at all necessary. Informant and other witnesses are Police witnesses hence, there is no possibility to threaten them or pressurize them. It was further argued that, applicant will not misuse his liberty by any manner and will abide any condition if so imposed by the Court. Learned Advocate for the applicant prayed to allow the application. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n06. Per contra, it is vehemently argued by learned A.P.P. that, the alleged offence is serious and if applicant is released on bail, possibility of repetition of crime and pressuring the witnesses cannot be ruled out. Learned A.P.P. prayed to reject the application. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n07. From the remand report dated 23/02/2019, it reveals that, on 22/02/2019 at 07:06 p.m., applicant was arrested and was produced before the Court on 23/02/2019. M.C.R. was sought and granted by the J.M.F.C., Phaltan. From the say of learned A.P.P. it reveals that, the tractor and trolley used in alleged offence has been seized by the investigation agency. Informant is Police Constable as such he cannot be pressurized at the hand of applicant. Moreover, when applicant was first time produced before J.M.F.C., Phaltan, M.C.R. was sought for which shows that personal interrogation with accused by Police is not necessary. Applicant is in jail from 23/02/2019. 08. Considering the nature of offence, considering the punishment provided for alleged offence, keeping in mind that applicant is not previously convicted, I am of the view that, it would be just, proper and judicious to release the applicant on bail by imposing some conditions on him so that he will not misuse his liberty. Hence, I proceed to pass following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER 1. Criminal Bail Application No.166/2019 is allowed. 2. Applicant, namely, Dattatraya Anna Manjule be released on bail on executing PB and SB of Rs.15,000/­. 3. The applicant is directed not to misuse his liberty by any manner and to attend the Phaltan Rural Police Station on every Sunday in between 11:00 a.m. to 02:00 p.m. without fail, till charge­sheet is filed. 4. Applicant shall not tamper with any evidence. 5. Applicant shall not directly or indirectly make any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the case so as to dissuade him from disclosing such facts to the Court or to any Police officer. 6. Applicant shall make himself available and co­operate with investigation and remain present with the Police as and when required by the Police. 7. Applicant is further directed not to commit similar type of offence. 8. If it is noticed that, applicant is disobeying the condition by non attending the Police Station, that should be the ground for cancellation of bail of applicant. \r\n---order-ends---\r\nSatara. Date : 05.04.2019. (N.D.Khose) Additional Sessions Judge, Satara."
