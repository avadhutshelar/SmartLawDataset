Initially accused was in PC. Now she is in MCR. 3] Advocate for applicant in his argument stated that quantity of seized Ganja is intermediate therefore bar under section 37 of NDPS Act is not applicable to this case. Stock of Ganja is already seized and nothing remained to be recovered or discovered from this applicant. Therefore, her further detention in jail is not necessary. Hence, she may be released on bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4] Ld. APP strongly opposed this application. It is his contention that this applicant was possessing said stock of Ganja with intention to sell it. Cash amount was also found in her possession. One Fulabai Mohan Abhange is also involved in this case. Co­accused of this applicant is yet to be arrested. If she will 2 be released on bail, it will be difficult to arrest them. Hence, this application may be rejected. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5] Investigation is at primary stage. During investigation it was revealed that this applicant brought said stock of Ganja from Fulabai Mohan Abhange for the purpose of sale. Her mother ­in­ law is assisting her in doing said anti social crime. Intermediate quantity of Ganja was found in her possession. Therefore, it will not be proper to release this applicant on bail at this stage.

Act. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n2] It is the case of the prosecution that on 03/01/2019 the applicant has been arrested by police of Anti­Narcotic Cell in Deccan Police Station in CR no.2/2019 under sections 8 ©, 20(b) (ii) (B), 27 (A), 29 of NDPS Act on the ground that she was found in possession of 1 kg. 100 gram Ganja along with cash amount of Rs.8,950/­. Initially accused was in PC. Now she is in MCR. 3] Advocate for applicant in his argument stated that quantity of seized Ganja is intermediate therefore bar under section 37 of NDPS Act is not applicable to this case. Stock of Ganja is already seized and nothing remained to be recovered or discovered from this applicant. Therefore, her further detention in jail is not necessary. Hence, she may be released on bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4] Ld. APP strongly opposed this application. It is his contention that this applicant was possessing said stock of Ganja with intention to sell it. Cash amount was also found in her possession. One Fulabai Mohan Abhange is also involved in this case. Co­accused of this applicant is yet to be arrested. If she will 2 be released on bail, it will be difficult to arrest them. Hence, this application may be rejected. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5] Investigation is at primary stage. During investigation it was revealed that this applicant brought said stock of Ganja from Fulabai Mohan Abhange for the purpose of sale. Her mother ­in­ law is assisting her in doing said anti social crime. Intermediate quantity of Ganja was found in her possession. Therefore, it will not be proper to release this applicant on bail at this stage. Hence, I pass the following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER Application is rejected. \r\n---order-ends---\r\nSd/­ ( S. S. Gosavi ) Date : 01­02­2019 Additional Sessions Judge,Pune.
