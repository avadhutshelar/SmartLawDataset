The applicant by this application under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure prays for bail in Regular Criminal Case No.87 of 2016. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n02. According to applicant, Regular Criminal Case No.87 of 2016 is pending before learned Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Koregaon. Non bailable warrant was issued against accused due to his absence. Accused was arrested and produced before the Court on 31.01.2019. Since 31.01.2019 accused is in jail. The bail application of applicant was rejected by learned Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Koregaon. Regular Criminal Case No.87 of 2016 is triable by Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Koregaon. Applicant is permanent resident of village Tadavale, Taluka Koregaon, District Satara, and as such, there is no possibility of his absconding. Applicant is karta of his family. Applicant is not previously convicted. Applicant will abide any conditions, if so imposed by this Court. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n03. From the say of A.P.P. at Exh.5, it reveals that, if accused is released on bail, there is every likelihood of his absconding and trial will be protracted. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n04. Heard learned Advocate for applicant. Adjournment application of learned A.P.P. is rejected. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n05. On perusal of record it came to my notice that, on 30.10.2018, non bailable warrant was issued against applicant. On 31.01.2019, accused was produced before learned Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Koregaon and his bail application came to be rejected. On perusal of order of learned Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Koregaon, it reveals that, accused was absent since the month of April 2017. Matter is held up due to the absence of accused for framing charge, hence bail application of the applicant came to be rejected. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n06. On perusal of record, it came to my notice that, the alleged charges against accused are under Sections 324, 504, 506, 510 of the Indian Penal Code which are triable by Judicial Magistrate, First Class. True that, as accused has jumped out the provisions of earlier bail, later on he was not released on bail by the learned Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Koregaon. However, considering the charges levelled against the applicant, considering the punishment provided for it, I think that no purpose would be served by keeping the applicant behind the bar.
