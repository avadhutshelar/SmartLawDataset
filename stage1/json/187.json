  "processedText": "Criminal Bail Application No.260/2019 CNR NO. MHPU01­000928­2019 Sajan S. Sukle and another …. Applicants. Vs. State of Maharashtra …. Respondent. \r\n---header-ends---\r\nORDER BELOW EXH.1 This is the first bail application under Section 439 of Criminal Procedure Code by accused / applicants in connection with C.R.No.135/2019, registered by Wakad police station, for the offence punishable under section 353, 333, 143, 145, 147, 148, 149 of Indian Penal Code and under Section 37(1)(3) r/w 135 of the Mumbai Police Act. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n[2] Perused the application and say given by prosecution at Exh.4. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[3] Heard learned advocate Mr.Bere for the applicants / accused and Mr. Aurangabadkar for the State. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[4] The learned advocate for applicants argued that the accused are falsely implicated in the present crime. The incident of gathering of mob had occurred in front of Wakad police station and at the most offence under section 160 of IPC is attracted. Only because the incident took place in front of police station, in order to have deterrence over the public at large, the accused are falsely implicated in the present crime. He further submitted that the substantial investigation is already done. The recovery of the weapon alleged to have been used for committing crime are also recovered. No purpose will be served by keeping the accused behind bars. The applicants / accused don\u0027t have any criminal antecedents and they will abide conditions if imposed. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[5] The learned APP for prosecution argued that the offence in question is serious in nature. The accused have assaulted police officers on duty with scythe and sticks. The investigation is in progress. He prayed for rejection of the application. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[6] I have gone through the FIR nd also the investigation papers. In reply given by police, it is contended that police head constable Mr. Bhandvalkar has received grievous injury and he is under treatment and if the accused / applicants are released on bail, there is likelihood of their repeating the crime. In the FIR, no specific role is attributed to the present applicants. Nothing is shown by prosecution to show that any of the applicants had inflicted the fatal blow causing grievous injury to police head constable Mr. Bhandvalkar. The accused / applicants are arrested on 10­1­2019. Having regard to the nature of the crime, the allegations in the FIR and the period for which the accused / applicants are in jail, I find no further purpose will be served by keeping the applicants / accused in jail. Hence, I pass the following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER [1] The application is allowed. [2] The applicant no.[1] Sajan Subhash Sukle, [2] Subhash Rama Sukle, [3] Lahu Bapu Sukle, [4] Anil Anna Sukle and [5] Shivaji Bapu Sukle are released on bail, on their executing PR Bond of Rs.20,000/­ each with one or two sureties of like amount, in connection with C.R.No.135/2019 registered by Wakad police Cri.B.A.No. 260/19 3 CNR No.MHPU01­000928­2019 station, on following conditions :­ [A] The applicants / accused shall not tamper with the prosecution evidence in any manner.
