State of Maharashtra) CNR : MHST01­004010­2018 \r\n---header-ends---\r\n1) This is the bail application under Sec.439 of Code of Criminal Procedure filed accused in C.R.No. 63/2019 registered at Satara City Police Station. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n2) Applicant was arrested in above mentioned crime on 22.01.2019. The said crime is registered in respect of the offence punishable under Section 353, 504, 506 of Indian Penal Code. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3) It is stated that, informant police officer lodged report against the applicant­accused that, when applicant was riding on motorcycle, informant stopped him and asked for papers, on which applicant did not respond and committed the alleged offence. It is contended that, the applicant has been falsely implicated in this crime, he is innocent, there is no no single allegation indicating assault on the complainant, required fine under Motor Vehicles Act is already imposed on applicant. Further it is stated that, applicant is student of B.A.III, studying in LBS College, hence, prayed for bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3) The prosecution has filed say Exh.6 to the application. It is contended that, applicant has no care of law, in case of grant of bail he is likely to pressurize the prosecution witnesses. Hence, prayed for rejection of the application. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4) Heard Advocate Shri. Hutgikar and learned A.P.P. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5) Considering the submissions, I have to mention that the offence against the applicant is triable by J.M.F.C., It is also contended that, while asking for documents of vehicle, the police officer was not wearing uniform, so there must be some misunderstanding. Further more, considering that, the applicant is student and the manner in which the alleged offence is committed, I find no reason for keeping the applicant behind the bars. The purpose of prosecution would be served if some stringent conditions are imposed upon him. Hence, I am of the opinion that, accused may be released on bail by imposing conditions. Hence, following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nO R D E R 1) Criminal Bail Application no. 46 of 2019, is allowed. 2) Applicant be released on bail on furnishing P.R.Bond of Rs.25,000/­ (Rs.
