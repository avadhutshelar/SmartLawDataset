Though investigation is completed material collected by the prosecution shows, involvement of the applicant- accused in the commission of crime. Investigation conducted shows, applicant-accused accepted and sold stolen muddemal property. In a such situation, having custody of the applicant- accused for further investigation by the police cannot be overlooked. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[7] Further it appears, for considerable period applicant- accused was absconding as a result charge-sheet is filed against her under section 299 of the Code of Criminal Procedure-1973. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[8] Thus, in such situation, and on considering parameters of the section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, in my considered opinion, this is not fit case to exercise discretion and to accept request made on behalf of the applicant-accused.
