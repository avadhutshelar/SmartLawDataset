State of Maharashtra) CNR : MHST01­000492­2019 \r\n---header-ends---\r\n1) Present bail application is preferred by the applicant Shirish Dilip Chavan, under section 439 of Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 seeking his release from arrest under execution of non bailable warrant issued in S.C.C. no. 234/2015. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2) It is contended by applicant\u0027s advocate that, applicant could not communicate with his advocate and also could not attend the dates of hearing, due to his financial and personal constrains. It is also contended that, erstwhile advocate did not inform the accused the dates of hearing and also accused remained to attend the Court. It is further contended that, accused is arrested upon his appearing before the Court for cancellation of warrant. Accused undertakes to co­operate in expediting the trial. Accordingly, bail is contended. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3) Bail application is resisted by the APP by filing say at Exh. 4 on the grounds that, evidence of the prosecution witnesses are recorded under section 309 of Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 and the matter is posted for recording the statement of accused under section 313 of Criminal Procedure Code, 1973. Accused is arrested under execution of NBW. It is contended that, the matter was prolonged due to sheer absence of accused. In case of release on bail, he may abscond and protract the trial. Accordingly, bail is resisted. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4) Upon hearing the APP and applicant\u0027s advocate and perusing the papers, it appears that, applicant/accused is arrested under execution of NBW issued by the Ld. JMFC Khandala. The offences charge are under sections 279, 337 and 338 of Indian Penal Code, 1860. Taking into consideration the fact that, accused was previously enlarged on bail and the reasons of miscommunication with the advocate, cannot absolutely be ruled out. At the same time, expeditious trial is also a grave concerned. Accused is in arrest since 07/02/2019. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5) In such circumstances, keeping the accused arrested pending the trial, would amount to punishment before trial, which is not justifiable. At the same time, APP\u0027s apprehensions shall also have to be considered for ensuring accused\u0027s presence at the hearing and facing the trial. The same can be secured by subjecting the accused to certain conditions. Hence, the following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nO R D E R 1) Criminal Bail Application no. 98/2018, is allowed; 2) Applicant Shirish Dilip Chavan, be released from his arrest under execution of NBW issued in S.C.C. no. 234/2015 upon paying penalty of Rs.2,000/­ (Rs.Two Thousand Hundred); and executing personal bond of Rs.25,000/­ (Rs. Twenty Five Thousand) with atleast one or more local surety/ies, to make up the bail amount; on following terms \u0026 conditions; a) Applicant shall not tamper with evidence. b) Applicant shall not directly or indirectly make any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the case so as to dissuade him from disclosing such facts to the court or to any Police Officer. c) Applicant shall attend each and every date of hearing, failing which the bail granted herein shall automatically stand cancelled. d) Applicant shall provide his address of availability and operative mobile numbers to the concern police station. Accused shall always be available through his given mobile numbers. e) Compliance before lower Court. \r\n---order-ends---\r\n(Y. H. Ameta) Place : Satara Addl.
