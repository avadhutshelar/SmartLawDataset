  "processedText": "Order below Exh.1 in Cri.Misc. Application No.90 of 2019 (CNR No.MHSTO1­000482­2019) \r\n---header-ends---\r\nThis is an application taken out by the accused applicants No.1 to 6 under section 438 of Cr.P.C. praying for their release on bail in the event of their arrest. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n02. By filing its say at Exh.09, prosecution strongly resisted the application. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n03. Heard Ld. Advocate Shri.P.T.Shedage for accused applicants and Ld. A.P.P. Mrs.Diwakar for prosecution at length. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n04. In view of the submissions, only point arises for determination is, “Whether the application can be allowed ?” My finding to this point is \u0027in the affirmative\u0027, for the reasons to follow : R E A S O N S \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n05. It is submitted on behalf of accused applicants that, the crime has been registered against them for offence punishable under Sections 498­A, 323, 504, 506 r/w 34 of the Indian Penal Code in Rahimatpur Police Station bearing No.19 of 2019. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n06. The grounds on which the accused claim to be released on bail are that, they are likely to be arrested, they are innocent persons and have been falsely implicated. The FIR is delayed and is the result of consult and deliberation. Only intention of lodging of FIR is to pressurise the applicants with all family members. Nothing is to be recovered from the applicants. Hence, custodial interrogation is not necessary. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n07. The accused are from respectable family, there is no likelihood of them to flee from justice. Applicants No.2, 3 and 6 require regular medical treatment and assistance. Applicant No.2 requires dialysis twice a week, applicant No.3 has cardiac history and applicant No.6 has suffered from brain hemorrhage. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n08. By filing say prosecution resisted the application with contentions that, the informant is wife of accused No.1. Other applicants are her in­laws. It is alleged that, the informant was subjected to cruelty and also alleged that, applicant No.1 had demanded money from her time to time. The investigation is in progress. In case of bail, possibility of pressurising the witnesses can not be ruled out. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n09. Heard both sides. The arguments advanced are as per the application and say respectively. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n10. Perused the FIR. The allegations are in respect to offence punishable under Sections 498­A, 323, 504, 506 r/w 34 of the Indian Penal Code. It shows that, custodial interrogation of any of the applicants is not necessary. The medical papers tendered by accused applicants show that, the applicants No.2, 3 and 6 are under medical treatment. In that circumstances, if the bail as claimed is granted on certain conditions, there would be no prejudice to the prosecution or in respect to investigation. In this type of offence, no purpose is going to be served by arresting the accused. On the contrary, their arrest may malign their reputation. For all these reasons, I proceed to pass following order : \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER 1. The application is allowed. 2. In the event of arrest of the applicants accused No.1 to 6, namely, Vikram Suresh Kambale, Suresh Ramchandra Kambale, Pratibha Suresh Kambale, Shital Suresh Kambale, Smita Sunil Kambale and Jivan Sadashiv Kamathe in C.R.No.19 of 2019 of Rahimatpur Police Station for the offence punishable under Sections 498­A, 323, 504, 506 r/w 34 of the Indian Penal Code be released on PR Bond of Rs.15,000/­ each with one solvent surety in the like amount on following conditions. (a) The applicants shall co­operate during investigation to the investigating agency. (b) The applicants shall attend concerned Police Station on every Monday since 12.00 to 03.00 at noon till investigation of the crime is completed. (c) The applicants shall not directly or indirectly make any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of accusation against them so as to dissuade them from disclosing such facts to the Court or to any police officer. (d) The applicants shall not threaten the informant or witnesses of prosecution in any way. 3. Failure to obey any of the conditions stated above would be liable for cancellation of bail granted to the accused forthwith. 4. Inform Rahimatpur Police Station accordingly. \r\n---order-ends---\r\nSatara. Date : 15.04.2019 ( Varsha B. Pargaonkar) Addl. Sessions Judge ­ 4, Satara."
