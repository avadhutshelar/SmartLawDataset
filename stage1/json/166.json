Respondent. \r\n---header-ends---\r\nORDER BELOW EXH.1 This is an application filed by the applicant Nos. 1 to 3 under Section 438 of the Criminal Procedure Code for anticipatory bail in C.R.No.472/2017 registered by Warje Malwadi Police Station under Section 406, 420 r/w 34 of the Indian Penal Code. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n[2] Perused the application and say given at Exh.7. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[3] Heard learned advocate Mr. Agarwal for the applicants / accused and APP Mr. Aurangabadkar for the State. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[4] The learned advocate for the accused / applicant submitted that applicant Nos. 1 and 2 were original owner of plot No.62, who started the school on said plot with the consent of Girish Co­operative Housing Society. There was some construction and notice was issued by corporation in the year 2010. The applicants / plaintiffs challenged the said notice by filing Reg. Civil Suit No.1314/2010, which was decreed in favour of the present applicants, who were the plaintiffs against which now the Civil Appeal No.98/2016 is filed and the same is pending. He submitted that meanwhile one of the member of the said co­operative society filed another suit bearing Reg. Civil Suit No.40/2010, seeking relief that the structure raised by applicant No.1, the Chairman of Tejas Education Society over the open plot be declared as unauthorized and directions to the defendant No.1, Pune Municipal Corporation for demolishing the said unauthorized structure and said suit was dismissed and RCA No.97/2016 is pending. He submitted that the very nature of the dispute between the informant and the accused / applicants is civil in nature. Moreover, all connected documents were already on record in both civil proceedings and, therefore, there is nothing to be recovered from the applicants. The offence alleged is not made out. The disputed building was being constructed in the year 1988 and both suits were dismissed in the year 2015 and thereafter now the informant gave a false application on 14.3.2016, on the basis of which FIR came to be registered on 28­ 12­2017, just to harass the applicants. He submitted that having regard to the nature of the dispute, the custodial interrogation of the applicants is not necessary. The applicants are respected citizens and old aged persons. They are ready to abide conditions if imposed. He prayed for grant of anticipatory bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[5] The learned APP opposed the application. He argued that illegal construction was raised over the property of the co­ operative society. Open plot owned by co­operative society was illegally sold. He prayed for rejection of the bail application. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[6] I have carefully gone through the documents filed on record by applicants and by learned APP. It is clear that informant Chandrashekhar Deshpande is the President of Girish Co­operative Housing Society first moved an application dated 14­03­2016 to the police and thereafter police recorded his statement on 28­12­2017 and registered the crime in question for the offence punishable under section 406, 420 of the I.P.C. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[7] It appears from the material on record that there is dispute between the applicants and the co­operative society and its members regarding the structure raised for school on plot No.62, situated in said society and also the structure raised on adjoining open plot alleged to be owned by said co­operative society. It is clear from the documents filed on record that the co­ operative society and its members first exhausted civil remedy and filed RCS No.40/2010, seeking mandatory injunction against the PMC, directing it to remove the unauthorized structure over the open space and said suit was dismissed. At the same time, the corporation appears to have issued notice to the applicants for removal of unauthorized construction over the open plot, which notice the applicants have challenged by filing RCS No.1314/2010, which was decreed in favour of the present applicants and appeals against the judgment and decree in both suits are pending. Thus, it is clear that the suit initiated by the co­ operative society when it was dismissed in the year 2015, subsequent President of the co­operative society approached police in the year 2016 and thereafter on the basis of report given by him, the present crime is registered in the year 2017. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n[8] It is clear that all relevant documents were filed by the parties in civil proceeding. Therefore, it cannot be said that the documents related to the alleged agreement were not available during investigation. The crime is registered in the year 2017 and till the date, the applicants / accused are not arrested by the investigating officer. Having regard to the earlier litigations between the parties and the allegations made in the FIR and the grounds put­fourth by the respondent in the reply given to the application for rejection of the bail application, I find that there is no need of custodial interrogation of the accused / applicants. There is no likelihood of applicants getting absconded. Hence, the following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER [1] The application is allowed. [2] The interim anticipatory bail order passed below Exh.4 dated 11­01­2019 is hereby made absolute, with the same terms and conditions. [3] Inform concerned police station accordingly. \r\n---order-ends---\r\nPune, Dated/­25­01­2019 ( Aniruddha Y. Thatte ) Additional Sessions Judge, Pune.
