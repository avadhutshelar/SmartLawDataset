The applicants, namely, Anita Lala Dhaigude and Lala Dattatray Dhaigude apprehending their arrest in C.R.No.41 of 2019 for the offences punishable under Section 306 r/w. 34 of the Indian Penal Code, registered with Lonand Police Station, have filed present application under Section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for anticipatory bail. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n02. Perused application. From the contents of complaint of Suryakant Bhau Kolekar dated 26.02.2019 in C.R.No.41 of 2019, it reveals that, on 24.01.2019 at about 5­30 p.m. he received phone on his mobile and he was informed that his daughter Suvarna Amol Dhaigude committed suicide on 24/1/2019 at about 4­30 p.m. at Balu Patlachiwadi, Tal. Khandala, Dist. Satara. From the contents of complaint, it reveals that, deceased written the chit wherein there is reference of names of both applicants for abetting deceased for committing suicide. From the contents of complaint it further reveals that, after having discussion with relatives, complainant lodged complaint against both applicants. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n03. Learned A.P.P. filed say at Exh.7. From the say of learned A.P.P. it reveals that, investigation is in progress. If application is allowed by the liberty of pre­arrest protection, applicants make inducement, promise or threat to the witnesses acquainted with the fact. Specimen handwriting of the deceased is to be collected from the applicants so as to verify the handwriting of the seized chit. So the documents of saving group are necessary to be collected from the applicants. The custody of applicants are necessary. Most of the witnesses are residing adjacent to the house of applicants. Therefore, possibility of pressurizing the witnesses cannot be ruled out. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n04. Heard learned Advocate for applicants. It is argued by learned Advocate for applicants that, there is inordinate delay in lodging the complaint and complaint is lodged afterthought. Complaint is not lodged by any of the family members of deceased but lodged by her father who is resident of village Malewadi, Tal. Phaltan. Complaint nowhere indicates that applicants by any manner abetted the suicide of deceased. The alleged incident had taken place on 24/01/2019 at about 04:30 p.m. and complaint is lodged on 26/02/2019. Applicants are permanent resident of Balu Patlachiwadi and they will not misuse their liberty by any manner and also ready to abide any condition if so imposed by the court. This is fit case wherein anticipatory bail can be granted. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n05. It is argued by learned A.P.P. that, the specimen of handwriting is necessary to be sent to the handwriting expert. The documents of saving group needs to be seized from the applicant. Custodial interrogation with applicants is necessary. If application is allowed, the possibility cannot be ruled out that, applicants will pressurize the witnesses. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n06. I have gone through the record. On perusal of complaint dt. 26/2/2019, it reveals that, same is lodged by father of deceased i.e. Suryakand Bhau Kolekar, who is resident of village Malewadi, Tal. Phaltan. From the complaint it reveals that the alleged incident had taken place on 24/1/2019 at about 4­30 p.m. at village Balu Patlachiwadi. From the complaint it further reveals that deceased was Secretary and applicant No.1 is President of Mahatling Mahila Bachat Gat, Balu patlachiwadi. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n07. From the contents of complaint it reveals that, there is reference in suicidal note which is as under, “ममाझझे समासस, समासरझे, पतत, ददिर सरर चमाचांगलझे आहझेत. त्यमाचांनमा कमाहत करू नकमा, बघमायचझे तर लमालमा, अदनतमा यमाचांच्यमाकडझे बघमा. चमाचांगगुणमा, पगुष्पमा यमाचांनमा नकक. समासस, समासरमा, पतत, ददिर यमाचांचत लमाडककी .” From the contents of complaint, it further reveals that, both applicants were harassing deceased on account of account of Bachat Gat. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n08. I have gone through the contents of complaint. First of all, it is necessary to mention here that, the alleged incident had taken place on 24/1/2019 at about 4­30 p.m. at Balu Patlachiwadi, Tal. Khandala, Dist. Satara. The complaint is lodged by father of deceased. None of the family members of deceased even though they are resident of village Balu Patlachiwadi have lodged the complaint. Both applicants are resident of Balu Patlachiwadi, Tal. Khandala, Dist. Satara. From the contents of complaint itself prima facie it reveals that, both applicants were demanding account of Mahila Bachat Gat from deceased. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n09. From the record it reveals that, applicant have not misused their liberty by which pre­arrest protection was granted to them by passing order below Exh.4 dated 02/03/2019. Both applicants are resident of Balu Patlachiwadi, Tal. Khandala, Dist. Satara and same fact is mentioned in complaint itself. Hence, there is least possibility of their absconding. For collecting the specimen handwriting of the deceased, to collect the documents from saving group, in my mind, the custodial interrogation of applicants is not at all necessary. The alleged chit has been seized. Considering the nature of offence, the delay in lodging F.I.R. considering the punishment provided for alleged offence, keeping in mind that, the complaint is not lodged by family members of deceased who are resident of village Balu Patlachiwadi, keeping in mind that ad­interim anticipatory bail was granted to applicants by passing order below Exh.4 on 02/03/2019, I am of the view that this is the fit case wherein interim protection granted to applicants needs to be continued by imposing some conditions on them. Hence, I proceed to pass the following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nO R D E R 1. Anticipatory bail application of applicants, namely, Anita Lala Dhaigude and Lala Dattatray Dhaigude is hereby allowed and order passed below Exh.4 dated 02/03/2019 is made absolute. 2. In the event of arrest in C.R.No.41 of 2019 punishable under Sections 306 r/w. 34 of the Indian Penal Coderegistered with Lonand Police Station, Tal. Khandala, District Satara, the applicants be released on executing PR of Rs.15,000/­ each with one solvent surety of like amount. 3.

The applicants shall co­operate with the investigating agency and not to misuse their liberty by any manner. 6. If it is noticed that, applicants are disobeying the condition by non attending the Police Station, that should be the ground for cancellation of bail of applicants. \r\n---order-ends---\r\nSatara.
