It is contended that, only dispute between the informant and the accused\u0027s family was of quarrels having taken place about 3 to 4 years back at Ganeshwadi, as a result of the informant\u0027s motorcycle colliding with this applicant\u0027s motorcycle. Said dispute was resolved at that time at village level. However, accused\u0027s family harboured enmity of it. Conspiracy can be even seen from the fact that, the accused male family members were keeping guard near the spot of incidence and fled away on motorcycles immediately thereafter. Accused\u0027s family forwarded the lady from their family to assault the informant and to scuttle the probable complaint of the informant, accused immediately rushed to file a false FIR against this informant, alleging the commission of offence punishable under section 354 of Indian Penal Code, 1860. Informant stays in the neighbouring of the parental home of Madhuri\u0027s and having fields adjacent to her father\u0027s field; therefore accused knew informant\u0027s caste and community. Irrespective of it, accused insulted and humiliated the informant in very filthy language. Informant was assaulted on 28/12/2018, however cognizance of his complaint was taken only on 01/01/2019. The complaint was not recorded as per the informant\u0027s narration, hence informant had lodged a complaint with the office of Superintendent of Police, Satara on 03/01/2019, alleging against the concerned police, refusing to take the informant\u0027s complaint in his verbatim. It is contended that, the police acted in high handed manner, under accused\u0027s family\u0027s pressure and recorded complaint merely under sections 324 \u0026 506 of Indian Penal Code, 1860 inspite of the incidences involving commission of offence punishable under section 307 of Indian Penal Code, 1860. Police acted as per the whims of accused and delayed the recording of this informant\u0027s complaint. FIR no. 357/2018 being registered against informant is false and filed merely to scuttle present FIR lodged by this informant against the present accused. Informant and witness\u0027s safety and security is at risk, hence accused need not be granted pre­arrest bail.

  "processedText": "ORDER BELOW EXH. 1 IN CRIMINAL BAIL APPLICATION NO.76/2019 (Pramod Mahadeo Ghadage Vs. State of Maharashtra) CNR : MHST01­000396­2019 \r\n---header-ends---\r\n1) Present application is filed by the applicant under section 438 of Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 apprehending his arrest under C.R. no. 01/2019, registered at Koregaon police station, at the instance of Nitin Kushaba Lavangare, for alleged commission of offences punishable under sections 326 \u0026 506 r/w. 34 of Indian Penal Code and also sections 3(1)(r)(s), 3(2)(va) and 6 of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act \u0026 section 7(1)(d) of Protection of Civil Rights Act. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2) It is contended by the applicant\u0027s advocate that, FIR is false and frivolously filed against this applicant and he has got no concern with any of incidences comprising the FIR. It is contended that, allegations against this applicant is of having instigated the accused Madhuri to assault the informant. It is contended that, vide supplementary statement informant has attached communal flavour to the FIR merely to aggravate the FIR and harass applicant. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3) It is contended that, said allegations against this accused are false and frivolously incorporated merely to implicate this applicant as he happens to be alleged assailant Madhuri\u0027s brother­in­law. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4) It is contended that, the informant was never stabbed, even by Madhuri. Allegations are unbelievable, as the informant himself mentions in the FIR of about more than 4, 5 persons, known to the informant, were present over there. It is contended that, in such circumstances, no person could dare to commit such offence. It is further contended that, informant is a Body Builder and Madhuri is a thin and slim lady, therefore also, it is impossible for the informant to be stabbed by Madhuri. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5) It is further contended that, present FIR is falsely and frivolously lodged after delay of about four days, to counter blast the prompt FIR no. 357/2018 filed by Madhuri against present informant at Koregaon police station for having outraged her modesty and behaved with her inappropriately on 28/12/2018. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6) It is contended that, incidence against Madhuri was committed by this informant on 28/12/2018 at about 5:30 p.m. and Madhuri had promptly lodged her FIR against this informant on the same day at 8:00 p.m. Madhuri had narrated the incident occurred in her FIR about this informant harassing her since her spinster days. This informant harboured one sided love for Madhuri, asked her for marriage; inspite of refusal to marry with him, informant had been continuously pestering and harassing her. On 28/12/2018, informant caught hold of Madhuri\u0027s left hand and spoke with her, in the manner that she would feel ashamed. Hence, Madhuri had lodged FIR no. 357/2018 against this informant. Present FIR is counter blast to the said complaint lodged by Madhuri. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n7) It is contended that, FIR can be seen to be false even from the informant\u0027s own conduct of travelling all the way about more than 25 kms. from Kinhai to Satara and getting admitted in a hospital specialized in Neurological ailments, whereas the informant\u0027s case allegedly involved only of a stab injury. There are many specialized hospital in Koregaon, just about 7 kms. from Kinhai. Informant got admitted in the hospital known to him and sought false certificate merely to harass this accused. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n8) It is also contended that, the medical certificate issued by the concerned doctor from the said Yashwant Hospital, is forged and fabricated as the date of admission mention on it carries interpolation and overwriting. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n9) It is also contended that, the informant has been visiting Courts since 02/01/2019, he is hail and healthy, did not suffer any injury and has lodged false complaint. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n10) It is contended that, the FIR can be seen false for the reason that allegations are of being stabbed with the knife and informant\u0027s states of his nephew removing the knife from the informant\u0027s body. But, nothing reveals from the investigation records as to how the knife is seized by police. Seizure of knife is unexplained and is shown to have been recovered even before arresting Madhuri. It is accordingly contended that, informant did not suffer any injury and the knife is planted in the investigation merely to harass the accused. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n11) It is contended that, allegations against this accused of having uttered any castiest slur or of having insulted the informant as to his caste are false and frivolous. Further, this accused did not assault the informant. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n12) It is contended that, informant had initially lodged a false complaint and has been daily improvising and aggravating his complaint merely to harass this applicant. Applicant has neither abused nor insulted nor humiliated the informant on his caste nor has even quarreled nor assaulted nor injured the informant. It is contended that applicant being falsely roped in the FIR about after 4 to 5 days of the alleged incidence, and the FIR being improvised, day by day, bar of section 18 or 18­A of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act 1989, shall not apply. Accordingly, pre­arrest protection is contended. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n13) In support of his contention, the applicant\u0027s advocate has placed reliance on the following rulings :­ i) Order dated 09/01/2019 passed by the Hon\u0027ble Bombay High Court in Cr. Appeal. No. 965/2017 in the matter of Sapana Korde nee Ketaki A. Ghodinde Vs. The State of Maharashtra; ii) Order dated 31/10/2018 passed by the Hon\u0027ble Bombay High Court in Criminal Appeal No. 1173/2018 in the matter of Sunil Mandevrao Thombre (Bavdhankar) and others Vs. The State of Maharashtra and another; iii) Order dated 11/10/2018 passed by the Hon\u0027ble Madhya Pradesh High Court in Cr.A.No. 7295/2018 in the matter Atendra Singh Rawat Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh; iv) Order dated 21/12/2018 passed by the Hon\u0027ble High Court Calcutta in C.R.M. No. 8302/2018 in the matter Debjyoti Bhattacharyya Vs. The State of West Bengal. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n14) Bail application is resisted by the APP by filing say at Exh. 7 on the grounds that, informant belongs to Hindu \u0027Chambhar\u0027 community recognized as \u0027Scheduled Caste\u0027. Accused has abused and insulted the informant on his caste in a market being a public place in a public view. Madhuri inflicted stab injury on the informant, from his back. Said assault could have risked informant\u0027s life, in case he would not have been rendered timely medical aid. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n15) It is contended that, the informant was initially taken to the Government hospital and then admitted in private hospital at Satara. Investigation in the matter is continuing, accused were absconding since the date of offence. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n16) It is further contended that, in view of the bar under section 18­A of the Special Act, pre­arrest bail application itself is not maintainable, therefore also, applicant/accused cannot be protected by grant of pre­arrest bail. Accordingly, bail is resisted. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n17) Notice of the bail application was attempted to be served on the informant Nitin Khushaba Lavangare, however vide police report dated 15/02/2019, concerned police has submitted that, informant is avoiding to accept the service of notice on him and also that, through his advocate, he is aware of the present bail application. Vide roznama notings dated 15/02/2019 and 16/02/2019, informant was provided opportunity to file say or to express his contentions in respect of present pre­arrest bail application. It was also clarified in the roznama notings that on informant\u0027s failure to submit his say, pre­arrest bail application, would be disposed without informant\u0027s say. Irrespective of these opportunities, informant remained incognito as far as this pre­ arrest bail application is concerned. Thus, it appears that, informant has chose of not contesting this bail application. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n18) Similarly, advocate Mrs. N.R. Benkar appearing for the informant in connected pre­arrest bail application being Cri. Bail Appln. no. 42/2019, arising out of same FIR, submitted that she is without instruction as far as pre­arrest bail is concerned and is unable to make submission in respect of present bail application is concerned. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n19) However, even if informant\u0027s submissions at Exh. 10 in connected pre­arrest bail application no. Criminal Application no. 42/2019, are to be considered, said bail application was resisted on the grounds that the informant was assaulted after a conspiracy hatched in this accused\u0027s family. It is contended that, only dispute between the informant and the accused\u0027s family was of quarrels having taken place about 3 to 4 years back at Ganeshwadi, as a result of the informant\u0027s motorcycle colliding with this applicant\u0027s motorcycle. Said dispute was resolved at that time at village level. However, accused\u0027s family harboured enmity of it. Conspiracy can be even seen from the fact that, the accused male family members were keeping guard near the spot of incidence and fled away on motorcycles immediately thereafter. Accused\u0027s family forwarded the lady from their family to assault the informant and to scuttle the probable complaint of the informant, accused immediately rushed to file a false FIR against this informant, alleging the commission of offence punishable under section 354 of Indian Penal Code, 1860. Informant stays in the neighbouring of the parental home of Madhuri\u0027s and having fields adjacent to her father\u0027s field; therefore accused knew informant\u0027s caste and community. Irrespective of it, accused insulted and humiliated the informant in very filthy language. Informant was assaulted on 28/12/2018, however cognizance of his complaint was taken only on 01/01/2019. The complaint was not recorded as per the informant\u0027s narration, hence informant had lodged a complaint with the office of Superintendent of Police, Satara on 03/01/2019, alleging against the concerned police, refusing to take the informant\u0027s complaint in his verbatim. It is contended that, the police acted in high handed manner, under accused\u0027s family\u0027s pressure and recorded complaint merely under sections 324 \u0026 506 of Indian Penal Code, 1860 inspite of the incidences involving commission of offence punishable under section 307 of Indian Penal Code, 1860. Police acted as per the whims of accused and delayed the recording of this informant\u0027s complaint. FIR no. 357/2018 being registered against informant is false and filed merely to scuttle present FIR lodged by this informant against the present accused. Informant and witness\u0027s safety and security is at risk, hence accused need not be granted pre­arrest bail. It is also contended that, the bail application is not maintainable in view of the bar of section 18­A of the Special Act. Accordingly, sister pre­arrest bail was resisted. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n20) Upon hearing the applicant\u0027s advocate, the APP, the informant\u0027s say in connected pre­arrest bail application no. 42/2019, perusing the say filed on record and also the other investigation papers produced on record, it appears that, allegations against this accused are of having insulted and humiliated the informant as to his caste in a market place, in public view. However, allegations of stabbing are not against this accused. It is even the informant\u0027s allegation of his complaint not being recorded as per his narration. However, informant\u0027s said grievance would be directed against the police. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n21) Material at hand also reveals past disputes between both the sides. On one hand, it is the informant\u0027s contention of the dispute pertaining to motorcycle accident 3 to 4 years back and the present assault being as a result of that enmity. As against this, it is present accused\u0027s case of the informant hovering around this applicant\u0027s wife since her spinster days, asking her for marriage, on refusal time and again harassing her and catching hold of her hand, lastly on 28/12/2018. It is the informant as well as this accused\u0027s contention of their FIR being genuine and the other party\u0027s FIR being a counter blast. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n22) It is also a matter of record that the weapon knife is shown recovered, even before effectuating any arrest under this FIR. In such circumstances, it appears that, no seizure or recovery remains to be done at the instance of this accused. 23) In the matter of Sunil Thombre (Supra), Hon\u0027ble Bombay High Court was pleased to protect the applicant/accused by grant of pre­arrest bail in respect of incidence dated 20/08/2018 i.e. after the introduction of section 18­A in the Special Act, on the grounds that the informant\u0027s caste was not disclosed in the FIR. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n24) In the matter of Atendra (Supra), Hon\u0027ble High Court was pleased to protect the said applicant/accused, observing that the allegations in the FIR did not match with the ingredients of section 3(1)(w)(i) of the Special Act. While granting pre­arrest bail, the Hon\u0027ble High Court had even considered provisions of section 18­A (2) of the Special Act. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n25) Similarly, in the matter of Sapna Korde (Supra), Hon\u0027ble High Court Bombay, considering the complainant\u0027s objection under section 18­A of the Special Act, was pleased to protect the applicant accused by grant of pre­arrest bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n26) In the case in hand, it is matter of record that, the informant alleges occurrence to be dated 28/12/2018, but FIR is lodged on 01/01/2019, the informant\u0027s complaint improvising in his supplementary statement dated 04/01/2019, there is no injury certificate issued by any Government hospital. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n27) Thus, taking into consideration the totality of circumstances, the ratio\u0027s in the cited rulings, the complaints and cross complaints, weapon already being recovered, frequent improvements in the informant\u0027s complaint, it appears that, custodial investigation would not be required, it appears that, bar of section 18 or 18­A of the Special Act would not be applicable to the case in hand. However, APP and informant\u0027s apprehensions are to be taken care of. Hence, the following order. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER 1) Criminal Bail Application no. 76/2019, is allowed. 2) In the event of arrest of applicant Pramod Mahadeo Ghadage, he be released on bail under C.R. no. 01/2019, registered at Koregaon police station, on his furnishing personal bond of Rs. 25,000/­ (Rs. Twenty Five Thousand) with atleast one or more surety/ies, to make up the bond amount, on the following terms and conditions :­ a) Applicant shall attend the concerned police station twice in a week preferably on every Monday and Friday in between 11:00 a.m. to 2.00 p.m. b) Applicant shall not tamper with any evidence. c) Applicant shall not directly or indirectly make any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the case so as to dissuade him from disclosing such facts to the court or to any Police Officer. d) Accused shall make available himself and co­operate for interrogation by Police Officer as and when required. e) Any default of above conditions shall render the bail to be cancelled automatically. \r\n---order-ends---\r\n(Y.
