  "processedText": "ORDER BELOW EXH.01 IN CRI. MISC. APPLN. NO. 146/2019 MHST01­000760­2019 Harlal Ganpatram Shingade Vs. State of Maharashtra \r\n---header-ends---\r\nThis is an application for regular bail as per section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Heard advocate Mr. A. R. Katkar for applicant. He submitted that in Crime No. 4/2019 registered with Satara Taluka Police Station for the offences punishable under sections 395 etc. of the Indian Penal Code, applicant is behind the bars since 18/02/2019. He was in police custody for three days from 23/02/2019 to 26/02/2019. Thereafter he is in Magisterial custody. Part of his custodial interrogation is over. His further presence is no more required by the police. \r\n---background-ends---\r\n2. He further submitted that he is local resident and is ready to obey with all the conditions those may be imposed upon him. He has no antecedents. In fact, informant has cheated this applicant for Rs. Five lacs and merely as a counter to the crime registered against him to that effect, he has lodged false and concocted FIR against this applicant. Therefore he submitted that applicant may be released on bail. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3. APP Mr. Oak by filing say at Exh.6 strongly resisted the application. He submitted that the informant has cheated this applicant for Rs. Five lacs and Crime No. 25/2018 is registered to 2/6 Criminal Bail Application No. 146/2019 that effect with Shahupuri police Station for the offences punishable under sections 420, 406 etc. read with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code. The informant along­with his friend Hukumsingh came to Satara from Rajasthan to attend the Court proceeding in that crime. Thereafter both of them went to Hotel Mile­Stone for dinner. That time, applicant and his associates went there and kidnapped informant and Hukumsingh. They made demand of ransom of Rs. Ten lacs from the brother of informant namely Jagdishsingh. When he denied for the same, applicant took informant and Hukumsingh at a remote and lonely place at one Resort near Koyana Back Water and assaulted them by means of iron pipe and belt for the purpose of recovery. Again they came back to Hotel Mahindra at Satara along­with informant and his friend Hukumsingh. On the point of revolver, they gave threats to both of them that if they lodged the FIR with the police, they would kill them. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4. He further replied that during the course of custodial interrogation, applicant has not co­operated the investigation machinery. After face to face confrontation, five unknown Marathi associates of this applicant are to be transpired and therefore the Investigating Officer has arranged for identification parade in a short period. Letter to that effect is also issued to the Tahasildar, Satara. The vehicles used in the commission of offence i.e. Fortuner and Innova Crysta cars are yet to be seized. Applicant and his associates have looted cash amount of Rs.12,800/­, ADHAR card, Voter ID and driving licence of informant. These documents along­with weapons used in the commission of offence i.e. iron pipe, belt etc. are to be seized. Applicant and his associates have forcibly obtained signs of informant and his friend on some blank papers. Those are also to be seized. They have also snatched mobile handsets of informant and his friend. In order to recover the dues, applicant has chosen illegal way. On all these grounds, he submitted that application may be rejected. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n5. After going through the FIR lodged by informant, it is seen that he was in such a frightened state of mind due to threats given by applicant that he went to his native in Jalore District in Rajasthan State and lodged FIR with Bhadratum Police Station. Since alleged offences are committed in the territorial limits of Satara Taluka Police Station, said crime came to be transferred by 00 number. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n6. It is also seen that, Crime No.25/2018 is registered with Shahupuri Police Station against the informant for cheating this applicant for Rs. Five lacs. He came to Satara from Rajasthan State to attend the Court proceeding in that Crime. Thereafter informant and his friend Hukumsingh went to Hotel Mile­Stone for dinner. They were followed by applicant and his associates. They kidnapped them and informant was compelled to make phone call to his brother Jagdishsingh and applicant and his associates demanded ransom of Rs.10 lacs from his brother Jagdishsingh. When he denied for the same, applicant and his associates took informant and his friend to a remote and lonely place in one Resort near Koyana Back Water and assaulted them by means of belt and iron pipe. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n7. Again they came back to Hotel Mahindra at Satara along­with informant and his friend. At the point of revolver, they gave threats to both of them that if they lodge FIR with the police then they would finish them. Due to such type of threats given to informant and his friend, both of them by traveling in a truck went to their native at Bhadratum in Jalore District in Rajasthan State and lodged the FIR against applicant and his associates. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n8. Applicant has surrendered before the JMFC, Satara and upon information to the police, they sought for his police custody. Accordingly it was granted from 23/02/2019 to 26/02/2019. But during custodial interrogation, nothing could be recovered from this applicant as according to Investigating Officer, he has given evasive answers and did not co­operate for investigation. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n9. It is alleged that in the said incident, applicant and his associates have robbed cash of Rs.12,800/­ of informant and the documents like ADHAR, Voter ID, driving licence etc. Vehicles and weapons used in the commission of offence i.e. iron pipe and belt are yet to be seized. It is also alleged that applicant and his associates have forcibly obtained signs of informant and his friend on blank papers at the point of revolver. Those papers are also to be seized. Not only that mobile handsets of informant and his friend are also robbed in the incident. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n10. Considering the gravity of offences and severe beating to the informant and his friend as is seen from the photographs in the police papers, it would not be just and safe to release this applicant on bail especially when investigation is in progress. Nothing is recovered at the instance of this applicant during the course of his police custody. Some more accused are transpired and face to face interrogation is required to be made. Identification parade is also being held shortly with the help of Tahasildar, Satara and correspondence to that effect is already made by the Investigating Officer. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n11. Taking into consideration the manner in which alleged offences are committed and threats with life injury were given to informant and his friend, it would not be just and safe to release this applicant on bail. If he is released on bail, entire investigation would be paralyzed. Alleged offence punishable under section 395 of the Indian Penal Code is too serious and therefore investigation in its proper perspective is required to be carried out. As such, no purpose of the prosecution would be served if some conditions are imposed. Application deserves to be rejected. Hence the order follows :\r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER Application is rejected. (Order is dictated and pronounced in the open Court) \r\n---order-ends---\r\nSatara (R.D.Deshpande) Dt.06/03/2019. Additional Sessions Judge, Satara."
