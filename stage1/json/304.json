  "processedText": "ORDER BELOW EXH.01 IN CRI. BAIL APPLN. NO.112/2019 Sudha Rajendra Kshirsagar etc.2 Vs. State of Maharashtra CNR­MHST01­000584­2019 \r\n---header-ends---\r\nThis is an application for anticipatory bail as per section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Heard advocate Mr. More for applicants. He submitted that Crime No. 36/2019 is registered against these applicants with Wai Police Station for the offences punishable under sections 498­A, 354 etc. read with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code. \r\n---background-ends---\r\nApplicants are having strong apprehension of their arrest in this crime. They are old aged. They are innocent. Main allegations are against their son namely Sunny Kshirsagar who is already arrested by the police and was produced before the JMFC, Wai. He is taken in Magisterial custody and is released on bail. The weapon allegedly used by him in the commission of offence is already seized. Therefore custodial interrogation of these applicants is not necessary. Allegations against these applicants are general and vague in nature. If they are arrested then their reputation would be maligned and therefore he prayed that pre­arrest protection may be granted to applicants. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n2. APP Mrs. Diwakar by filing say at Exh.8 resisted the application. She replied that these applicants along­with their son have subjected the informant to cruelty of physical and mental type. Applicant No.2 under the influence of liquor has insulted her modesty. If pre­arrest protection is granted to these applicants then they are likely to threaten the informant and prosecution\u0027s witnesses. Therefore, she prayed that application may be rejected. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n3. After taking into consideration the averments in the FIR, this Court has already granted ad­interim pre­arrest protection to applicants by an order dated 14/02/2019. In the say filed by prosecution at Exh.8, nothing could be revealed so as to cancel ad­interim pre­arrest protection granted to applicants. So far as allegations against applicant No.2 regarding insulting of modesty of informant are concerned, those are of the year 2014. But the FIR is lodged on 11/02/2019. \r\n---argument-ends---\r\n4. Considering this aspect, ad­interim pre­arrest protection granted to these applicants deserves to be confirmed on the same conditions. This is also because that custodial interrogation of these applicants is not at all warranted. There is nothing which is to be seized from these applicants. Hence the order follows :­ \r\n---argument-ends---\r\nORDER 1 Application is allowed. 2 In the event of their arrest in Crime No. 36/2019 registered with Wai Police Station for the offences punishable under sections 498­A, 354 etc. read with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, applicant No. 1 Sudha Rajendra Kshirsagar and applicant No. 2 Rajendra Raghunath Kshirsagar be released on anticipatory bail, upon their executing P.
